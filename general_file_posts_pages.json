The EF Media server provides a bidirectional audio channel to clients and can serve as a voice input during an IVR or a gateway to integrate third party AI-based voice bots such as voice transcription. The conversation meta data bus shares real-time data between the parties (customer, bots, agents, supervisors) that are part of a conversation. This can be individual activities (a spoken sentence, chat message, geolocation, translation, voice biometrics, answer suggestions,...), key-value pair Conversation Data (customer profile, call tags) and forms. Various Ai engines that can be integrated become part of the conversation control and can be programmed to act at any point in time during the conversation. For example, to implement transcription, the media server would create a unidirectional SIPREC connection to an ai bot which then receives the voice stream. The output of the AI engine (text) would go to the conversation metadata bus and from there it can be displayed on the agent desk and written into the transcript. AI engines can be from standard 3rd party providers or also Open Source components. Various static and also real-time information relating to the conversation is made available on the agent desktop\n. Which information is visible can be controlled at any point in time during the conversation, provided that the agent has the access rights for a particular data. 3rd Party components\n, such as Cisco CUBE Learn More\nsolutions designed with conversation Studio\nThese solutions come pre-bundled as templates with EFCX and you can use them out of the box or adapt them to suit your specific needs.

Get in Touch\nSurvey as a part of the Conversation\nOutbound conversations can include multiple attempts/ sessions across multiple channels (chat, email, voice,..) and the exact flow can be defined with our graphical Conversation Design tool. By using multiple channels, a campaign can reach prospects through their preferred communication method and increase the chances of conversion. For example in an outbound voice campaign, customers can be sent an email upfront informing them about an upcoming call. The email can contain a link offering more information, which allows tracking of interest on the customer side and triggers an agent to call them. Voice CPA (call progress analysis) can be used to track the progress of voice calls in outbound campaigns. Possible scenarios: When an agent finishes the call, he transfers the call or chat session directly to an IVR or chatbot that speaks or displays the questions and collects the answers from the customer and fills in a form, which attaches that data as conversation data to that conversation.

If the customer chooses to do so, the conversation flow sends an SMS to the caller with a URL that initiates a chat. A chatbot is then launched in the chat session, which becomes part of the same conversation as the original call.

It is the responsibility of the customer to provide these prerequisites. For any defect reported in the licensed software, ExpertFlow does not commit to providing a Hot Fix. ExpertFlow shall use reasonable efforts to correct the fix, within a future maintenance release as part of legal warranty.

Usually, these will require a change request and commercial quote. However, the Expertflow project manager can decide to include these changes at no additional charge for the customer, as \u201cGoodwill\u201d. Deliverables included as \u201cGoodwill\u201d will be done without legal obligation, goodwill, and on a \"best effort\" basis, without contractual commitment on deliverables or timelines. Expertflow may stop without reason and further obligation the deployment of the additional functionality which was not part of the original commercially agreed project scope. Expertflow will however communicate any deviation of \"goodwill\" functionality, and track it as any other project deliverable.

A mutually agreed Change Order will take precedence over the SOW in the event of conflict. If a requested change is complex, Expertflow may determine that additional fees and/or an adjustment to the Project schedule are required for a full evaluation. In this case, Expertflow will submit an \u201cEstimation Change Order\u201d and will proceed with the evaluation and response to the request only after agreement by the Customer/Partner.

Indemnification by ExpertFlow\n. ExpertFlow will pay all Damages and defend Customer from and against all claims brought against Customer by a third party alleging that Customer\u2019s use of the ExpertFlow products as permitted by this Agreement infringes or misappropriates a third-party copyright, trade secret, trademark or patent (\u201cIP Claim\u201d); provided Customer: (a) promptly notifies ExpertFlow of all allegations of any such IP Claim, (b) grants ExpertFlow exclusive control over the defense and settlement of any such IP Claim (except that ExpertFlow may not settle an IP Claim against Customer unless the settlement releases Customer of all liability related to the IP Claim), and (c) gives ExpertFlow any information it reasonably requests in connection with the defense of the allegation.

All expenses including travel and visas for ExpertFlow engineers to come onsite, as well as living expenses inside the country will be paid by the customer. For any committed onsite work, ExpertFlow engineers will travel to the work location, as long as the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( \"the MOFA\", http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/fr/home/travad/ travel.html) considers it safe to do so. If during the onsite stay, the MOFA recommends foreigners leave or not visit a particular location, all onsite ExpertFlow personnel will leave the country immediately, and the additional travel cost will be borne by the partner. Any cost due to security measures as recommended by the Swiss MOFA will be borne by the partner. If a location is considered to be unsafe, the project will be completed remotely only, and training will take place over WWW collaboration sessions. The on-site charges can then be deducted from the total project amount with the final payment. ExpertFlow is an equal opportunity employer. ExpertFlow commits to providing the deliverables outlined in this offer with the engineers most qualified and appropriate for the work at hand. This is being done regardless of nationality, sex, or religious beliefs. ExpertFlow does not commit to making one particular engineer available for a certain task or project. If CVs are joined in the bid document, this is to illustrate the type of engineers that ExpertFlow will deploy during the project. Engineers are assigned if and when work occurs and based upon the task at hand, and availability of the best available resource. ExpertFlow therefore doesn't commit in advance to a particular person for a particular project. \u200bNon-disclosure, non-solicitation, and intellectual property Design and architecture documents provided by ExpertFlow are the intellectual property and ownership of ExpertFlow. The same applies to documentation provided by the customer. Such documents will be used exclusively for the purpose of using the platform as deployed by ExpertFlow. In case of non-award of a project, such documents will be returned to the originating party, and any copy thereof available destroyed. This obligation of confidence doesn't apply to information that becomes generally available to the public, is available to the customer before receiving such information from the releasing party, is made available by a third party that has no such obligation to the releasing party, or is required by law to be disclosed. Either party may disclose that ExpertFlow is Customer\u2019s vendor and that Customer is an ExpertFlow customer. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after the later of the date of this Agreement or the completion of any SOW under this Agreement, each party agrees not to, directly or indirectly, initiate employment discussions with, hire or use in any way the services of an employee or contractor of the other Party (ExpertFlow, partner and customer). The parties specifically agree that a material, uncured breach of this provision will entitle the non-breaching Party to agreed-upon liquidated damages in the amount of fifty thousand dollars $50,000 per occurrence with a maximum aggregate limitation of $500,000. Subject to the time limitation set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph, this provision applies to employees and contractors who are no longer employed by the injured party but were so employed at any time during the term of this Agreement. ExpertFlow (or its licensor, if applicable) retains sole title to and ownership of all intellectual property including the source code and patents of the Supported Software and Updates, all related information furnished under this Agreement, and all related copyrights. However, the licenses and the entitlements procured by Customer will be owned by Customer. \u200bLegal conditions and liability The terms of this agreement are entered into force by the customer and partner ordering any services or software from ExpertFlow, and ExpertFlow accepting to provide these services for a certain period or project. It ends after the last agreed service has been provided by ExpertFlow to the partner. A project is considered \"ordered\" by ExpertFlow and legally binding to ExpertFlow once ExpertFlow sends a \"PO acceptance\" to the partner, re-stating the exact scope and T&Cs to the partner. In case of a legal dispute, the competent court of jurisdiction is in Berne, Switzerland, and the language will be English, with each party paying his own legal fees. Alternatively if specified so, and in order to speed up a legal settlement, an international Arbitration under United Nations UNCITRAL (www.uncitral.org) processes will govern settlements of disputes, applying Swiss Rules of International Arbitration in force on the date on which the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The number of arbitrators shall be one, and the partner is free to choose any arbitrator that is a member of the Swiss Arbitration Association (\nhttp://www.arbitration-ch.org/\n), and ExpertFlow will accept that arbitrator. The arbitration fees of the arbitration panel or third-party legal fees will be borne jointly by both parties, and each party will bear its own travel costs. IN NO EVENT SHALL ExpertFlow BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY COSTS OF RECOVERING, REPROGRAMMING, OR REPRODUCING ANY PROGRAM OR DATA STORED IN OR USED WITH ExpertFlow INSTALLED SOFTWARE, OR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY CORRUPT OR INADEQUATE DATA, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, ExpertFlow TOTAL LIABILITY TO THE CUSTOMER/PARTNER UNDER THIS LICENSE SHALL BE LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF THE PROJECT FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY THE CUSTOMER/PARTNER UNDER THIS CONTRACT. THE CUSTOMER/PARTNER RELEASES ExpertFlow FROM ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, OR DEMANDS IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITATION. THIS LIMITATION SHALL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED WARRANTY OR REMEDY HEREUNDER IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. If a cost is incurred due to missing SW licenses ordered to ExpertFlow, or for which ExpertFlow charged ATP margin, ExpertFlow will participate in the missing cost of these SW licenses up to a total amount of 10% of the entire project value ordered to ExpertFlow, by assuming 50% of these costs, deductible from the final payment of the project. 50% of these costs will be paid by the partner. \u200bTermination/ Survivability Once a purchase order is sent to ExpertFlow, the full amount is due to ExpertFlow at the latest 12 months after the PO is received, independently of project status. In case of bankruptcy of the customer, or in case of a take-over, the debts due to ExpertFlow will have the most senior status right after statutory legal salary and social security payments for employees. ExpertFlow can terminate a project/ purchase order by reverting to the customer all payments that the customer made to ExpertFlow for that project/ PO and thereafter has no further obligations to the customer. The non-disclosure and non-solicitation remain in place for three years after editing. \u200bForce Majeure Non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences. When the impediment is only temporary, the excuse shall have effect for such period as is reasonable having regard to the effect of the impediment on the performance of the contract. The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on its ability to perform. If the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, it is liable for damages resulting from such non-receipt. Nothing in this article prevents a party from exercising a right to terminate the contract to withhold performance or request interest on money due.

Information entered by call center agents is retrievable in CUIC reports. Agent scripts can be edited on the fly by a supervisor. They are frequently used in call centers for purposes such as to train new resources in handling certain types of queries, to record customer feedback during planned outbound campaigns\n. Automatically activate the right script depending on the call type. Using Agent guidance scripts helps in saving training time, thus, operational costs and in minimizing call handling times. \"Agent Guidance\" described here manages the content of a conversation. All modules of CIM work seamlessly together and exchange the same notion of \"customer\". Form Designer\nBusiness administrators can design their form schema in any way they want and add as many number of form fields as required. For details on the supported field types, see Forms Documentation\n. Flexible Viewing Options\nControl how you'd like your form to be displayed. Customize the layout and design the form the way you require. This is done on the client-side app rendering the form from the EF Forms Admin App. Client apps can also implement their own logic to control hiding or showing some form fields/ questions. Collect Form Responses\nThe schema of the form and submitted for data are kept separate from each other. This allows you to collect the form responses from the user and store them in any of your preferred databases for reporting purposes. RESTful APIs\nCreate and embed your forms anywhere using RESTful Form APIs. The APIs support JSON response for the client apps to implement the form view on their side. The future version will also support HTML response along with the JSON response. Agent Gadget in Cisco Finesse\nThe Forms gadget embedded in Cisco Finesse serves as a guidance script for Cisco UCCX/CCE agents to ask appropriate questions and record customer feedback. The form opening logic can also be implemented on the gadget to open the right type of form based on the Dialed Number (DN)/ queue OR the outbound campaign. This allows call center agents to ask a certain set of questions and gather customer feedback during their calls with the customer.

Agents see all past interactions (calls, chats, social media comments) of that user with the company, and can reply to a FB comment directly within the embedded FB comment editor as a public comment (or within the embedded Youtube Iframe reference). Public comments/ responses of the agent will not be stored within that user's interaction history. Alternatively, the agent can choose to execute a channel switch and reach out to the user either with Facebook Direct Message or via any other known customer identity.\nBi-directional chat vs. Social Media\nSocial Media comments (FB Comments, Twitter posts. Instagram Comments,..) are different from private direct messages (DM), for example, Twitter DM or FB Messenger, in that they are a public group conversation. Other differences are: there are multiple users that can comment on a post comments are public \u2013 at least to a group \u2013 and not private. As a consequence, Answers by the agent to that comment/ post will NOT be stored in the customer interaction history, as these are public. CIM/ HC will only store the information that the client posted. It will however do so by maintaining a metadata link to the relevant FB comment, so it can be viewed in context. Blogs are initiated by the company on one of their owned social media pages, not by customers requiring services. There is no notion of thread, dialogue, sequence, or hierarchy. Comments related to a blog but rarely to each other (depending on the social media platform). Chat requests require an immediate real-time response and a continuous dialogue. Comments on a social media page can be responded to after a certain duration, and require a single-step action, not a continuous dialogue. So they are similar in nature to an email. Twitter Monitoring\nTwitter Direct Messages are supported out of the box by Expertflow Hybridchat. The paid Twitter APIs allow companies to search, monitor, analyze and respond to public Tweets. The standard Twitter offer allows one to make 1000 requests per 24 hrs interval\n. The search and filter/ NLU function is essential for Twitter, but not essential for Facebook page comments or for Instagram Page comments. Tweets deemed interesting by the initial filter can be forwarded to agents in the same way as Facebook comments - this occurs in a cloud service as a bespoke development in front of Hybridchat. Expertflow Hybridchat only enters into action after the initial Search and Filter function.

The redundant SBC allows you to purchase phone numbers and phone traffic from your preferred operators in any country. If you frequently place international calls to certain countries, you can also integrate with several local operators to reduce your international calling charges. If you have very small branches, and SIP connectivity is not available or affordable, you can buy a SIP-ISDN (with a BRI or PRI) or SIP-Analog gateway in your local market (starting at 200 USD for a BRI) and then use our SBC to connect your Microsoft Teams installation to your operator: This also allows you to purchase fewer phone numbers from the operator than you have Microsoft Teams users.\nAdvanced Voice Features Advanced voice features that are easier to implement in a separate IPT environment include: IVR, Voicebots Standards-based WebRTC voice and video Integrating ISDN and analog devices CRM integration (for example to Salesforce, Oracle Siebel, Oracle Service Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics,...) for click-to-dial and customer screen-popup Voice recording Workforce Management Outbound Campaigns Advanced routing strategies and skill-based routing Integration to external chat channels (Whatsapp, FB Messenger,...) Measuring voice quality. With our virtual SBC, users from Microsoft Teams can reach IP-PBX users that have more advanced features and vice versa. Expertflow provides advanced voice features as SaaS, in it's cloud UCCaaS offering\n. Microsoft Teams is a very powerful solution in the B2B sector, where you primarily interact internally in teams across multiple channels. It has, however, limitations in B2C interactions where you interact primarily with external users, and where the main tool used is not Teams but for example a CRM (or where a Teams license would be too costly). In such scenarios, you typically need a separate PBX (Experflow provides on-prem Cisco UCCX/ PCCE/ UCCE or cloud-based Freeswitch/ FusionPBX), which can provide such functionality.\nMicrosoft Graph API\nMicrosoft Teams is continuously rolling out new features, so it might be that at some point it can provide features similar to a dedicated IP-PBX (albeit at a certain cost). Many of the above features can be made available through the Microsoft Graph API, and Expertflow might release features that it currently only provides only on Cisco or Freeswitch and also on Microsoft Teams. Besides SIP and telephony connectivity between Microsoft Teams and an IP-PBX, companies might want to see logical information. For example, an agent in a call center using in a Cisco case Finesse (UCCX, PCCE, UCCE), or Expertflow's Cloud Callcenter could see users of Microsoft Teams, without actually requiring a Microsoft Teams license, or without requiring a Microsoft Teams license. Such IP-PBX users would not have the capabilities of teams or require a telephony license, but they could still interact with them. Such a scenario would make sense if you have dedicated call center users who from time to time need to reach out to Microsoft Teams users, or forward calls to the same.\nPrerequisites and pricing\nEither one of the following configurations: Microsoft E1, E3, or Business Basic with Microsoft Teams plus Phone System Microsoft Office 365 plus Business Voice Microsoft E5 The additional Microsoft Business Voice license cost is approx. 8 USD per user per month. You are responsible for: configuring Microsoft Teams ensure sufficient bandwidth and QoS between your Microsoft Teams users and your operator. Voice Traffic is not transiting through the Expertflow SBC (it only handles signaling), and calls are encrypted end-to-end between your premises and your operator, so we can't control voice quality.

We are proactively recruiting across all our offices so as not ot have a single point of failure . This includes various nationalities and religions (Coptic Christians, Muslims Hindus, Christians). This is not only done with the intent to support clients locally, but also with the intent for business continuity in regard to working hours, holidays, language, tribes/ ethics (we intentionally hire both Shia and Sunni in Pakistan, both Yoruba and Ebo in Nigeria, both Coptic Christians and Muslims in Egypt. We prefer to hire women and minorities. We see diversity as an essential factor to stability and regularly discuss culture internally - including for ex training on how Pakistanis and persons from India can work together, how we fight corruption, how we ensure data privacy for our customers, how people should dress on camera in which country. IT continuity\nWe have since the beginning of Expertflow since 2007 worked internationally together at a distance via remote tools. So as long as there is Internet, there is Expertflow. In all larger offices we have UPS that last two hours, a Diesel Generator with sufficient Diesel to run the office for several days, two independent glass fiber trunks and (unarmed) guards. We share.\u00a0and plan all information and tasks online (a CRM, ticketing, Jira,...), so we know at any point what somebody was working on. We use either large cloud services (Google Workplace), or when hosted on our own, generate regular backups of all servers (on AWS, Digitalocean, Contabo) - we also take physical backups. We enable 2FA for all tools where available, and are currently implementing central IAM (Identity and Access Management). There is a four-eye principle for sensitive actions, and the CEO has admin access to all tools. COVID-19\nWe have a home-at-work policy for all our employees. Coming to the office is optional, voluntary and discouraged. We have installed air filters in all office rooms, sanitation/ sterilization stations, and all our frequently-touched spaces (door handles, toilets,...) are disinfected on a regular basis. Mask-wearing is mandatory. Our offices follow Cov guidelines by local authorities. The CEO has direct access to a senior Epidemilogist in Switzerland. Expertflow implements the more stringent of measures (either by the local authorities or Switzerland) Emerging Markets - Political Unrest/ Corruption\nExpertflow has offices and is operating in Emerging markets. This comes with it's own challenges. We had in the past had a bomb exploding close by and shattering windows. We had regular power interruptions, glass fibers being destroyed (once by construction workers, once in Kenya stolen because there is a tradition of stealing copper wires), ocean fibers being cut, political unrest and demonstrations, curfews. We have Dengue in Pakistan, Malaria in Westafrica, which strikes once in a while somebody or their close ones. There are late payments, sudden currency controls and bankrupcies of clients. This could result in irregular cash flows - as a result we broadened our geographical coverage in order to have no client corresponding to more than 10% of our revenue. We regularly have employees leaving for better-paid jobs abroad, so we hire and train continuously and have a well-oiled onboarding process. These challenges are business as usual for us. It's because we have these continuous challenges, that we're probably more resilient and adaptive than companies operating in more stable environments. We always anticipate that something could mess up and that we need some slack so we can deliver according to Western standards. That we have challenges doesn't reduce our standard against which we aim to deliver. Policy Leadership\nThe CEO is designated responsible for this business continuity management system program. Resolution of issues in the development of, or support of, all plans and associated activities is directly coordinated with the CEO. Corrective Action Plan\nIn situations where a department does not conform to this policy, the CEO will prepare a report stating the case for non-compliance and present it to the relevant process owner/team lead for resolution of the non-compliance. Implementation\nThis Policy is implemented through the application of Expertflow's Quality Management System (QMS), to drive continual improvement.

Strategy\nOwnership, revenue and earnings\nExpertflow is a (cloud) CX/contact center vendor, directly competing with five9\n, ringcentral\n/ for customer care, and with liveperson for live chat. Strategic assets are our connectivity to, CRM solutions (Microsoft Dynamics, SAP, Salesforce,..) UC solutions (Cisco, Microsoft Teams, Freeswitch.) chat platforms (Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, SMS providers, Viber, Telegram,..) AI engines (IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Amazon Lex, rasa.ai, Microsoft Cognitive Services,...) ... as well as our strong and diverse customer base primarily in MEA and South Asia, mainly large banks and mobile operators. Expertflow is entirely owned by the CEO Andreas Stuber and his wife, and r\negistered with the Chamber of Commerce of Berne in Switzerland\n, Register UID CHE-113.962.601 in 2007. See the entire history\n. Expertflow was boot-strapped and has no external investors. All subsidiaries of Expertflow have a mutual franchising/ mutual exclusivity agreement for a certain territory (Middle East, Africa and South Asia) with a notice time of on year. The earnings of the entity in the territory are shared between the local Managing Director and Expertflow LLC Switzerland. There are no exclusivity agreements for non MEA/ SouthAsia regions (representing 500 kUSD). All intellectual property belongs to Expertflow Switzerland. Most payments by customers are made by clients to Expertflow Switzerland (3 Mio USD annual revenue until 2021, from 2022 on, this will be 5 Mio annually). An additional 1 Mio is collected locally (Egypt, Maghreb, Pakistan) to pay local expenses - all earnings are then sent to Switzerland. Revenue is 90% Expertflow's own software and services. Resale of third party products represents less than 500'000 USD. Expertflow re-invests all it's earnings into software development, currently 500'000 USD p.a. We plan to continue doing so. History\nExpertflow started as a systems integrator specialized on large corporate customer service contact centers in MEA and South Asia, primarily on the basis of Cisco. Many of Africa's largest banks and Operators are customers of Expertflow. By 2080, Africa, India and Pakistan are expected to have a total population of 4.6 bn of a World population of 9.3, so 50% of the planet's population. As the population in these countries gradually grows out of poverty, it will start consuming customer service software (via banks, operators, government entities,...) The company has 160 employees, of which 70 full-time SW developers, 95% of which are located in Pakistan, India, Egypt, Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa. Since 2015, Expertflow has been developing software around Cisco Callcenters, for which it won global awards. This on-prem software has been deployed in it's own customer customer base, but also globally (clients in Taiwan, Bangkok, the US, Ukraine, Portugal, Panama,...). Our contact center software can be consumed by companies clients on a pay-per-use subscription basis (ranging from 10 to 140 USD per user per month). The heart is our contact center, Hybridchat and customer interaction solution\n, the UC portion can be provided by EF or run as a service on top of Cisco, Microsoft Teams or Freeswitch. We also connect to major CRM solutions such as Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, Oracle CX and Sales Cloud, SAP. We now provide our solution as a SaaS. This is not yet common in the UCaaS Market in MEA and South Asia, and if served, then at the wrong price level. Also, there are no relevant references or local points of presence/ compliance with local regulatory frameworks especially in countries that have restrictive requirements regarding the use of VoIP. We have no plans to acquire any companies or assets but would be interested in regional partnerships, in particular where we have little presence such as in the Americas, Europe or East Asia. Current valuation, investors and exit strategy\nWe value Expertflow at 15 Mio USD. Typical valuations for cloud CC companies are 6 times annual revenue. We don't need cash for our immediate growth before 2024. We would like to find an investor for a complete or partial exit at any time before 2037 (the year of retirement of Andreas Stuber), and will be more interested over time. Additional investment could accelerate our growth, so we would consider that if the strategic fit and valuation are right. Another reason why we're not yet looking for an investor is that we think the valuation will increase until 2025, as we will demonstrate our capability to acquire customers in the USA, as well as more deployments of our cloud solution. We see potential exits / strategic investors in the following domains: UC companies like Cisco, Twilio, Microsoft, Amazon Connect that lack Livechat, CRM connectors, Customer Data repository WebRTC capabilities Livechat companies (intercom, Livechatinc, LiveAgent) that lack Cloud Contact Center capabilities CRM companies that would like to acquire cloud contact center/ customer service/ chat capabilities (Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP,...) Chatbot/ NLU/ AI companies that require UC capabilities to integrate into corporate customer service environments US, European or East Asian companies in the customer service sector that seek a presence and access to corporate clients in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia For financial investors for which we might be a fit, we would seek: a board-level exchange a joint long-term vision before 2037: Either an exit scenario, or building up an executive board that can take over shared vision as for the perspective of Expertflow, as well as a realistic investment/ business plan. This could be the establishment of an executive board in Europe, and more rapid strenghtening of our Cloud Customer Service offering in MEA and South Asia.

Expertflow has a policy of non-interference into such incentive programs - we consider these to be internal company policies. Incentives are cash payments, presents above a value of 100$, travels, kickbacks or immaterial benefits. Bribes and corruption are if such incentives are made with the intent to influence an employee of another company against the interest of that other company. We will not give any such incentives to employees (or persons or companies related to them) of our clients, suppliers or partners. If this is not possible, such as in ad-hoc situations, (such as paying on-site for some goods required for a project, travel expenses, lunch,...), and if the value is above 100$, then the designated supervisor within the company that employs this individual will be informed of this incentive (either by the employee or by Expertflow). Examples of situations, were when such an incentive could favor a company in the award of a bid, in order to get a project signed off, in order to get a special rebate from a supplier or to get a payment released. Expertflow has in the past and will look forward always to decline such incentives. Similarly, our clients and partners need to be sure who Expertflow and its employees are. Expertflow employees therefore neither receive nor pay direct incentives from or to our suppliers, partners, or clients, neither personally, nor in the name of Expertflow. Any such act will be followed by a summary dismissal of the employee in question. We also request our suppliers not to incentivize our employees in any way or form. Any incentive to Expertflow should be done directly to Expertflow only, and never to an employee. Expertflow trains its sales and presales team on this policy. For deals above 100,000 USD, the CEO is personally involved and aware of commercial negotiations. As a general guideline, Expertflow follows the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) corruption prevention guidelines. The CEO is therefore personally liable under the Swiss Criminal Code Art 322 for acts of corruption\n. As a general rule, all payments with customers or partners transit through the bank accounts within Expertflow Switzerland, subject to supervision by Swiss authorities and banks that irregularly request details on certain payments made abroad. Financial auditing of all transactions is done by Treuhand Zentrum in Berne, Switzerland - an external auditor. Policy Competitive pricing\n: In order to be able to maintain competitive pricing, and besides reducing core costs, we mitigate project risks as much as possible. These can be currency risks, project risks, product risks, information security risks, or risks of unexpected costs (for example in the form of the above incentives). Dealing with companies\n: We conclude legally binding and enforceable contracts with companies, not with individuals. Individuals involved in a project might change, and their responsibilities might change, but the companies remain the same. Whereas we aim to have a good personal working relationship with all employees of our partners and clients at a personal level, and also coach and train our employees on how to achieve this, there is a red line between \u201cgood working relationship\u201d and \u201cincentives\u201d. Reputation and legal risk\n: Expertflow has been able to grow and thrive without handing out incentives. Whereas our growth might possibly have been smaller because of it, it is also more reliable. Being involved in a corruption case could permanently damage everything that we built up, our reputation, and our hard work in one single stroke. We earn decent but not extraordinary salaries and are proud of what we can deliver. We don\u2019t need to buy trust. We earn it. FAQs \u201cIn this region, everybody does it?\u201d, \u201cCan't you win a deal without doing it?\u201d\n: That\u2019s wrong, and our existence proves the contrary. We have been able to survive and grow for quite some time and are now the largest player in our target markets without giving any incentives. We are large and geographically diversified enough so that we don\u2019t depend on the favor of one individual. \u201cDo you also need to pay something back to the country that you\u2019re working in?\u201d All our growth in terms of employees has been in Emerging markets, where we also have our clients. We have never paid out any dividends to Shareholders - any earnings are immediately reinvested into the company's growth in the form of salaries to employees in these countries. So we invest more into emerging markets than we take from them. \u201cDo you report corruption?\u201d No, we don\u2019t proactively report corruption if we see it happening between two companies, nor if we are approached by such. In most cases, we hear or see rumors, which is not sufficient for a legal case. Similarly, we don\u2019t monitor or comment on how our partners win deals. We don\u2019t have any political, religious, or ethical agenda. Our business is to provide excellent, secure, and reliable professional IT services, and all our efforts go into that only.

Expertflow provides a plugin that enables mautic to send text messages across any chat channel, using the award-winning Hybridchat solution\n, that uses the Expertflow Customer interaction data repository\n. Responses from customers could be simple (un-)subscriptions, but they could be the beginning of a longer chat conversation, including chatbots and contact center agents. Chatbots can fill out digital forms by asking questions in a chat conversation. Interactions and customer profiles can be synced between the Mautic and the CIM database. The voice plugin is an evolution of the former voice campaign manager feeds the Cisco Outbound Dialer in permitted time windows, and enables administrators to start/ stop campaigns. It also provides real-time campaign progress. Supervisors can modify campaign prompts. New events/ triggers to Mautic\nThe Expertflow plugin adds new triggers to Mautic, such as inbound calls, chat initiation requests from the customer, CSAT scores, supervisor QA scores, and more. These triggers can be configured in Mautic to initiate new actions on a customer's journey. Data sync between CRM, Mautic, CIM\nA CRM, Mautic, and CIM all have a notion of customer and interactions, so it's possible to synchronize some or all data. The difference is that Mautic's job is typically to gradually gain more information about a customer. Contacts in a CRM typically are qualified and there was human interaction. The focus of CIM is to drill down into each individual interaction point such as a spoken sentence or a single chat message. Campaign Reports\nDigital campaigns (Email, Chat, WWW) are executed immediately without delay, without involving agents. Digital campaign reports are available on Mautic\n. Voice campaigns on the other hand require time of human agents and the contacts, as well as multiple re-attemps to reach a customer. They are executed over a longer period of time, and require information such as agent performance, agent quality scores and the like. These reports are published on Cisco CUIC. Agent Guidance Scripts\nThe Forms module allows to create scripts for agents, which can be linked to an outbound campaign. Information gathered from agents in these forms can be made available for reporting.

Agents using a web app, a contact center Desktop app (for ex Cisco Finesse) or your CRM (Oracle Siebel, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Oracle Service Cloud, SAP,..) ..and chatbots (IBM Watson Assistant, Microsoft LUIS/ Botframework/ Cognitive Services, Google Dialogflow, rasa.ai,..) your callcenter (Cisco, Genesys, Freeswitch or FusionPBX) The bot is is managing the bulk of the chat conversation and is automatically assisted by a human agent whenever the bot's confidence score is low (\"\nhybrid chat\n\"). The bot will continue to auto-respond after a timeout, the duration of which depends on the bot's confidence score. If the bot is not able to answer the question and no agent is available, it can suggest a callback. You could also say that the agent is assisted by the bot - a so-called AI assisted agent. The conversational platform can also work without bots, simply connecting multiple chat channels to agents. It can also integrate with multiple bots/ dialogue engines/ virtual concierges, so the Chatframework or CC agent can choose the best answer from several bots. You are not bound to any particular bot. Relevant tagged training data is stored in a way to allows changing from one bot framework to another. The chat tab of each customer is color-coded, indicating the bot\u2019s confidence score of it's NLU (Natural Language Understanding) for that particular conversation. This score also determines the hold time until the bot\u2019s primary answer will be sent, unless the agent manually overwrites the bot\u2019s suggested answer before the timeout. Hybrid Chat Instead of a basic handoff from a bot to a human agent, where most of the conversation will continue to be handled by an agent, Hybrid chat engages and uses the bot during the entire conversation. This reduces the workload to call center agents or allow them to handle more conversations in parallel. An agent can serve and blend in and out to multiple chats in parallel. Hybrid Chat in Cisco Finesse Hybrid Chat agent gadget can be embedded in Cisco Finesse, or it can run independently of any contactcenter, as a basic live chat solution. Hybrid Chat in Microsoft Dynamics 365\nHybrid Chat Agent Gadget can be embedded in Microsoft Dynamics 365 or USD (Unified Service Desk) to allow an agent to handle chats from within the CRM. The integration also allows automatic customer profile screen-pop on chat arrival. This builds on our established CRM connectors\n. Mobile Agent The mobile client for Android and iPhones enables agents to serve clients while they are on the go, without access to a desktop. Audio Notifications inform them of incoming chats. This is ideal in situations where you have either a low volume, with infrequent chat requests, or with very high volumes where you need to onboard agents on the fly. Rich Messaging\nRich Messaging, such as Carousels, buttons, Geo-location,.. are fully supported across chat channels that support these. Visual IVR Hybridchat is also a Visual IVR. Enrich or complement IVR sessions with a chat experience, for example by exchanging SMS messages with callers while they are being queued on the IVR to an agent. Chatting and choosing options from a visual menu is faster than listening through lenghty menus, so the customer experience will improve. Alternatively, for conversational IVR solutions, it allows you to capture information that might not have been captured properly by a speech recognition engine. Anothfr use-case is to get the GPS geo-location\n. of the caller. Once the call is transferred to the agent, the agent can continue the chat session that was initiated via the visual IVR. Available with Cisco CVP\n. Media Blending and campaigns Media blending means that agents will serve alternatively voice calls or chat/ emails, depending on the volume of incoming requests as defined in the contact center's skill based routing. Hybridchat leverages your contact center for media routing, reporting, CTI, skills and agents, with fetures such as: Details of any interaction (voice, email, text) are stored in CIM\n, so if your customer calls you at noon and then calls at four, the bot will be aware that this chat might be related to a previous call. Chat messages are stored as activities and can be synchronized as such with Cisco Context Services POD's. If you plan to launch an SMS campaign and a customer calls before you execute the campaign, the agent receiving a call could handle the case while he's on the call with the customer, and the scheduled OB call won't be placed. If there are many Voice Calls, you could postpone answering temporarily to Emails or Chats. Or the Chatbot could inform the user that he can\u2019t answer this particular question, but that your company would be happy to call him back once an agent becomes available. The callback request is then forwarded to the Expertflow Campaign Manager and to the Cisco Dialer. Hybridchat comes along with a multi-channel campaign management license. This blog describes how chat ties into campaign management . Hybridchat or Cisco ECE/ Socialminer UCCX Chat? Expertflow Hybridchat completely replaces and is independent of Cisco Socialminer, Cisco UCCX chat and Cisco ECE. It is technically feasible to also use Hybridchat with Cisco ECE for UCCE or CCX Socialminer Chat, but this is rarely chosen by our clients. In the basic version, Hybridchat provides channel adaption to multiple chat channels, and an integration to multiple chatbots, and then executes a handoff to the Cisco-native Chat tools. It is also possible to have a Hybridchat gadget running alongside either ECE chat gadet or CCX chat after the handoff. This blog describes how this can be achieved, and what the limitations are. In most cases, our clients choose to completely replace ECE or Socialminer CCX chat with Hybridchat. Consequently, we provide the integration with ECE for CCE or Socialminer for CCX only on a per-project base, and not as a product that we document, regression test and fully support across all Cisco versions. Advantages of Expertflow Hybridchat Hybridchat is a Middleware between Bots, Chat Channels, Contact centers and CRM solutions. You remain free to switch and combine bots, chat channels, your contact center and CRM at any point. There is no lock-in. Works on both CCX and CCE, standalone or (Summer 2020) with Genesys PureEngage, so you can seamlessly migrate from one version to the other without changing your setup on chat, chatbots or chat channels. All conversation data, NLU and conversation models are stored on your premises under your control, so you can re-use your training data if you want to re-train a new AI engine. HC is part of the CIM framework which is built to apply AI not only to chat but also to voice and other channels. Hybrid chat supports rich messaging, such as carousels, cards, buttons (Status Jan 2020: for Viber and Whatsapp) HC manages attachments (pictures and audio) and stores them in a DMZ so you can have them approve by your Antivirus Sequential or parallel bots Hybridchat allows you to use multiple Chat Bots in parallel or in sequence, allowing you to quickly adapt to your requirments. Exchange bots while maintaining your NLU training data Use certain bots for certain domains (small talk, address change, order fulfilment, tracking). Use bots in sequence, in particular for message filtering (SPAM, blacklists, abusive language, data loss prevention, two-factor authentication 2FA, PCI-DSS compliance) Training your AI and Chatbot with real data\nThe agent can tag intents and entities in the message and can also select response amongst the answers that the bot suggests (highest-scoring answers), or draft a new response to the customer. From the bot\u2019s perspective, everything proceeds as if it was a normal dialogue. Tagged Messages and validated conversations (by the agent) can be used as training data to the bot, in order to improve further recognition rates (NLU) and answers (Dialogue Engine). To further speed up training, we'll soon be providing automated clustering of similar messages between humans to detect frequent intents or actions.

Hybrid Chat in Microsoft Dynamics 365\nHybrid Chat Agent Gadget can be embedded in Microsoft Dynamics 365 or USD (Unified Service Desk) to allow an agent to handle chats from within the CRM. The integration also allows automatic customer profile screen-pop on chat arrival. This builds on our established CRM connectors\n. Mobile Agent The mobile client for Android and iPhones enables agents to serve clients while they are on the go, without access to a desktop. Audio Notifications inform them of incoming chats. This is ideal in situations where you have either a low volume, with infrequent chat requests, or with very high volumes where you need to onboard agents on the fly. Rich Messaging\nRich Messaging, such as Carousels, buttons, Geo-location,.. are fully supported across chat channels that support these. Visual IVR Hybridchat is also a Visual IVR. Enrich or complement IVR sessions with a chat experience, for example by exchanging SMS messages with callers while they are being queued on the IVR to an agent. Chatting and choosing options from a visual menu is faster than listening through lenghty menus, so the customer experience will improve. Alternatively, for conversational IVR solutions, it allows you to capture information that might not have been captured properly by a speech recognition engine. Anotehr use-case is to get the GPS geo-location\n. of the caller. Once the call is transferred to the agent, the agent can continue the chat session that was initiated via the visual IVR. Available with Cisco CVP\n. Media Blending and campaigns Media blending means that agents will serve alternatively voice calls or chat/ emails, depending on the volume of incoming requests as defined in the contact center's skill based routing. Hybridchat leverages your contact center for media routing, reporting, CTI, skills and agents, with fetures such as: Details of any interaction (voice, email, text) are stored in CIM\n, so if your customer calls you at noon and then calls at four, the bot will be aware that this chat might be related to a previous call. Chat messages are stored as activities and can be synchronized as such with Cisco Context Services POD's. If you plan to launch an SMS campaign and a customer calls before you execute the campaign, the agent receiving a call could handle the case while he's on the call with the customer, and the scheduled OB call won't be placed. If there are many Voice Calls, you could postpone answering temporarily to Emails or Chats. Or the Chatbot could inform the user that he can\u2019t answer this particular question, but that your company would be happy to call him back once an agent becomes available. The callback request is then forwarded to the Expertflow Campaign Manager and to the Cisco Dialer. Hybridchat comes along with a multi-channel campaign management license. This blog describes how chat ties into campaign management . Hybridchat or Cisco ECE/ Socialminer UCCX Chat? Expertflow Hybridchat completely replaces and is independent of Cisco Socialminer, Cisco UCCX chat and Cisco ECE. It is technically feasible to also use Hybridchat with Cisco ECE for UCCE or CCX Socialminer Chat, but this is rarely chosen by our clients. In the basic version, Hybridchat provides channel adaption to multiple chat channels, and an integration to multiple chatbots, and then executes a handoff to the Cisco-native Chat tools. It is also possible to have a Hybridchat gadget running alongside either ECE chat gadet or CCX chat after the handoff. This blog describes how this can be achieved, and what the limitations are. In most cases, our clients choose to completely replace ECE or Socialminer CCX chat with Hybridchat. Consequently, we provide the integration with ECE for CCE or Socialminer for CCX only on a per-project base, and not as a product that we document, regression test and fully support across all Cisco versions. Advantages of Expertflow Hybridchat Hybridchat is a Middleware between Bots, Chat Channels, Contact centers and CRM solutions. You remain free to switch and combine bots, chat channels, your contact center and CRM at any point. There is no lock-in. Works on both CCX and CCE, standalone or (Summer 2020) with Genesys PureEngage, so you can seamlessly migrate from one version to the other without changing your setup on chat, chatbots or chat channels. All conversation data, NLU and conversation models are stored on your premises under your control, so you can re-use your training data if you want to re-train a new AI engine. HC is part of the CIM framework which is built to apply AI not only to chat but also to voice and other channels. Hybrid chat supports rich messaging, such as carousels, cards, buttons (Status Jan 2020: for Viber and Whatsapp) HC manages attachments (pictures and audio) and stores them in a DMZ so you can have them approve by your Antivirus Sequential or parallel bots Hybridchat allows you to use multiple Chat Bots in parallel or in sequence, allowing you to quickly adapt to your requirments. Exchange bots while maintaining your NLU training data Use certain bots for certain domains (small talk, address change, order fulfilment, tracking). Use bots in sequence, in particular for message filtering (SPAM, blacklists, abusive language, data loss prevention, two-factor authentication 2FA, PCI-DSS compliance) Training your AI and Chatbot with real data\nThe agent can tag intents and entities in the message and can also select response amongst the answers that the bot suggests (highest-scoring answers), or draft a new response to the customer. From the bot\u2019s perspective, everything proceeds as if it was a normal dialogue. Tagged Messages and validated conversations (by the agent) can be used as training data to the bot, in order to improve further recognition rates (NLU) and answers (Dialogue Engine). To further speed up training, we'll soon be providing automated clustering of similar messages between humans to detect frequent intents or actions.

From there, calls are routed to your agents that only need a web browser. In case of non-responsiveness, failure, or overload of a server, calls are automatically load-balanced to one of the other close servers for continuity, and agent connectivity is automatically balanced to the surviving server. You can mix on-prem servers for data privacy/ proximity/ low round-trip delays, and still use the Expertflow server farm as a failover environment.

Mobile Chat client: Agents receive live chat over any chat channel (website, Facebook Messenger, Viber, Whatsapp,\u2026) using Expertflow\u2019s Hybridchat solution. They can also work alongside existing chatbots. What sets the Expertflow solution apart from other CRM connectors is that we also provide controls for chat and digital channels. Secondly, agents can receive phone calls directly through a WebRTC webphone embedded in your CRM, without requiring a physically installed softphone or hardphone. Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX), Enterprise (UCCE or PCCE) Pricing Documentation\nShow Pricing\nIncoming Call Alerts for Remote Agents\nUsing Cisco Mobile Agent (CCE) and Cisco Extend&Connect(CCX) features, agents receive incoming calls from the contact center on their phone line. Once the call is answered, agents continue to use the ExpertFlow Mobile Agent App for other call controls such as hold/resume, transfer, conference, view call attached data, and/or apply wrap-up while ending the call, using simple internet without any VPN. Finesse State Changes from Remote Locations The same Finesse state changes as on the desktop versions are available to agents in this mobile app. For instance, field support or sales engineers can login to the mobile app as \"Mobile Agent\", make themselves Ready for calls, and start taking customer calls while they are on the move. Furthermore, agent states are maintained even when the app runs in the background or when the phone is locked (until the user session expires). Call Attached Data As in the Finesse desktop version, agents see the call attached data about the ongoing call within the mobile app. This helps to deliver a consistent, on-floor contact center experience to customers. Furthermore, it also allows agents to handle customer queries effectively even when they are away from the call center floor. Call Wrap-ups Agents may select and push wrap-up codes at the end of the call using the mobile app as they do with Cisco Finesse Desktop. Solution Architecture\nExpertFlow Generic Connector regulates the communication between ExpertFlow Mobile Agent and Cisco Finesse Server. We suggest setting up a reverse proxy in the Enterprise DMZ that secures the communication between the server components in the LAN and the Mobile app accessible publicly. The following EF server components are deployed in the LAN: Mobile App Server: T\nhis is the server that hosts the mobile client app and, can be deployed on the same VM as Generic Connector or as a separate VM in the Enterprise LAN. Generic Connector (GC): GC is connected to the Cisco Finesse Server to monitor and push changes regarding agents' states and call controls to Finesse. For more details on architecture and callflow, see Architectural Docs\n. Mobile Chat Finesse Client\nThe mobile agent for telephony (a Finesse client for mobile phones) and mobile agent for chat are two separate apps. Its part of the roadmap to merge into a single unified mobile app to handle voice, non-voice customer requests. To the right is a screenshot of the existing mobile chat app.\nUse cases Field sales and support engineers are constantly on the move. It\u2019s almost impossible for them to sit inside the contact center premises and take customer queries. Mobile Agent app allows such engineers to be available as contact center Mobile Agents and take customer inquiries remotely. Out-of-office hours: Supervisors or experts usually need to remain available to attend to VIP customers outside of office hours. EF Mobile Agent allows them to answer VIP/ urgent calls outside of the contact center time and premises. Branch representatives as Mobile Agents: It is often needed to transfer customer calls to specific branch representatives while they are moving on the floor. EF Mobile Agent allows the branch staff to login as Mobile Agent and take customer calls while moving.

Calls are recorded & stored as individual call legs including call hold, call transfer and call conference. The recordings can be archived, deleted or downloaded, and a RESTful API provides access to all objects. Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX), Enterprise (UCCE or PCCE) Pricing Documentation\nShow Pricing\nThe API can also be used to extract information from a voice stream or individual sentences (separated by non-speech periods). These can be fed to speech analytics, such as Voice Biometry, Speech Recognition or Emotion Detection algorithms. With the CIM API Pipeline\n, output from these can then in turn be fed into a Chatbot or NLU engine to predict knowledge base articles or agent activities relevant to the current state of the conversation. How we record\nRecording is done with \"Built-in Bridges\" \u201cBIB\u201d \u2013 an approach that uses the conference bridge available for almost all Cisco IP phone types. The Recording streams are forked from an agent IP phone to the EF-recorder. The agent and customer voice are sent and stored as separate call legs. They are then mixed by EF-Recorder. Recording is initiated by CUCM using SIP commands. EF_Recorder is configured on CUCM as a SIP trunk device/ SIP server in order to receive calls and recording streams. It captures every SIP event. Based on those events, recording is done using RTP. The three components of the solution are the Recorder and the Mixer. The Recorder has data structures implemented to store details of a call in memory. It stores call sessions, call legs, as well as the complete call in a data structure. Once a customer-facing call ends, it then links all legs to a single call object. The identification of each call is done via Xrefci Id from SIP Packets using rapid in-memory storage. The Mixer is responsible for merging all legs of a call into a single playback session, and optionally store it as a .wav file depending on the configuration. REST APIs are used to fetch and play/download recordings from the database. Search & Play\nThe Voice Recording Solution allows to search & play the recordings based on certain parameters like AgentId, agent Extension, date filter, customer number, etc. Multiple-legged calls\nWe support recording calls in the following scenarios, Transfer Hold / Resume Conference Integration with CIM\nWhen purchased Expertflow CIM, users can also view the past interaction history of the customer along with links of the call recordings in the Interaction History gadget.

It tracks customer journeys across all channels (voice, chat, web) with an emphasis on real-time communication. It can be used standalone, or it can be configured to be integrated with Cisco or Freeswitch/ FusionPBX voice environments. It acts as a company directory/ phone book for the same. It tracks interactions at a granular level (spoken sentences, chat messages), and shares them with CRM software, marketing tools and AI solutions. Combine it with a Digital Marketing solution to obtain a Customer Experience Management solution. Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX), Enterprise (UCCE or PCCE), Freeswitch, FusionPBX Pricing Documentation\nAPI Developer Guide\nShow Pricing\nCIM allows you to plan, track and execute in parallel any form of customer interaction across all interaction channels (chat, voice, web, email), and analyze the same with an AI/ NLU tools of your choice to provide answer suggestions and automate interactions. Customer Profile and phone book, Interaction History, Customer Context\nManage customer profiles with: Various customer identities (= channels) such as phone numbers and email addresses. Works as a Contact Address Book or Phone Book for click to call or click-to-chat Any customizable field such as Customer preferences such as preferred language, contact timings, secured PIN, preferred agent or cla\nssification such as VIP, malicious, or more. The customer profile automatically pops up on the screen when a call or chat from that customer comes in. Context-sensitive interaction history is presented to the agent for journey tracking. An interaction could be an inbound call having an IVR activity (an IVR trail) and one or more agent activities such as call wrap-up/ call transfer / conference call. Other interaction types include SMS, Email, chat, social media. learn more \u2192 Track, Analyze, Predict with AI\nHaving all your interactions tracked in CIM, you can use these activities for tagging, such as tagging a recorded voice file with information from that an agent entered. You can then analyze them, extract information and predict actions. Expertflow Hybrid Chat for example uses an NLU to extract intents and entities from a chat message. It then uses a conversation engine to predict the next best answer. The original message, recognized intents, entities and actions are then forwarded to the callcenter agent, all retrievable over the same chat channel. A chat session with a customer is a subscription to activities for a certain customer. Campaigns\nLinking customer profiles to campaign contacts, ExpertFlow Campaign Manager makes it possible to create campaigns based on customer identifiers such as VIP, malicious, DNC or any other field. Based on the history of calls to the customer, the business can also decide a better customer engagement policy, such as to provide a promotion to eligible or interested customers only. *Integration with Expertflow Campaign Manager is a part of a future release learn more \u2192 Callback Solution\nSchedule an automatic callback for an abandoned call or other call outcomes. Based on the outcome of the last interaction, the solution can automatically push certain contacts for a callback.

This includes the right to have personal data deleted or modified upon a citizen request. CIM links and groups together all information per customer occurring in a contactcenter. By doing so, it allows you to identify, retain, protect, modify and delete personal data in a systematic way. Integration with Cisco Context Services\nCIM replaces the following Cisco Context Service (CCS) objects (no longer supported by Cisco)\n, and provides the similar API's. CIM has similar objects, as follows: CIM Customer = CCS Customer CIM Activity = CCS Activity/ POD. This can be an agent screen activity, a chat message (in Context services an entire chat is an activity - which in CIM is an interaction), a SIP leg in a call, call tagging, or a filled in questionnaire (agent guidance, customer survey or supervior QA score) CIM interaction = CCS Request. This groups together several SIP call legs into one single call. For an outbound campaign, multiple call attempts, the call, and the result of the questionnaire filled in by the agent. CIM also adds the notions of channel - a company or customer can have multiple channel ID's, namely for chat agent ticket - or issue. This can span multiple interactions or calls, and have a long duration and has a status.

Agents (Slack, Cisco Spark, Microsoft Teams, CRM-specific that tool, Expertflow's multi-chat Finesse Gadget, Cisco ECE Chat,..) ..and bots (IBM Watson, Microsoft LUIS, Google Dialogflow, rasa.ai,..) It allows you to combine all three, for example Handoff\u00a0a Customer-Bot chat to a contact center agent A bot can suggest answers to an agent that is chatting with multiple clients (\"hybrid chat\") The video on the right shows a customer that is received by Microsoft Botframework, handed off to an UCCX agent, who then follows up on the chat from within his chat gadget in Microsoft Unified Service Desk. Escalate a WWW-chat session to a video session between the customer and the agent. Request Quote\nHandoff & Media Blending An important feature is Handoff from the bot to a contact center agent with media routing/ media blending. Most bots reach to a point where they can\u2019t answer the customer\u2019s request so therefore a handoff strategy is essential when deploying a bot. Media blending means that agents can serve alternatively voice calls or chat/ emails, depending on the volume of incoming requests. So if there are many Voice Calls, you could, for example, postpone answering temporarily to Emails or Chats, or the Chatbot could inform the user that he can\u2019t answer this particular question, but that your company would be happy to call him back once an agent becomes available. It is also possible for a bot to run in parallel to a human agent, suggesting quick answers for the agent to select from. This features is provided with Hybrid Chat module. Hybrid Chat Instead of a classical handoff from a bot to a human agent, where most of the conversation will continue to be handled by an agent, Hybrid chat has the advantage that it makes the bot to blend in and out of any chat, thereby generally reducing the workload to call center agents. Expertflow Hybrid Chat conferences the Bot with Cisco Contact Center agents. The hybrid chat connects to any customer-facing chat environment (SMS, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Web-chat), and initiates a chatbot session on bot (IBM Watson, Microsoft Bot framework, Rasa.ai, or other ). The call center agent receives the same chat within a hybrid chat gadget on Cisco Finesse, routed through Cisco CCX or CCE Mediarouting. An agent can also serve multiple chats in parallel. The chat framework continuously sends the bot\u2019s best suggestions to the call center agent within the chat gadget. The chat tab of each customer is highlighted with a color code indicating the bot\u2019s confidence score. The confidence score also determines the hold time for a timer until when the bot\u2019s primary answer will be sent, unless the agent manually overwrites the bot\u2019s suggested answer.\nAgent Tagging\nThe agent can tag intents and entities in the message and can also select response amongst the answers that the bot suggests (highest-scoring answers), or draft a new response to the customer. From the bot\u2019s perspective, everything proceeds as if it was a normal dialogue. Tagged Messages and validated conversations (by the agent) can be used as training data to the bot, in order to improve further recognition rates (NLU) and answers (Dialogue Engine). A differentiator of the EF Hybridchat solution is also that it directly enables (senior) agents to not only use hybrid chat, but to also tag messages on-the-fly, so that the same messages don\u2019t need to be reviewed twice (once by the agent, once by a person doing tagging).

At that moment, using IVR deflection, the caller can be directed to an automated service provided in a chat channel. IVR deflection makes use of the following: Implementing self-service for chat is easier than for voice (speech is messier than text) and If an agent needs to be involved, he will be able to handle multiple chat sessions vs. only one voice call at a time, so the agent\u2019s work time is used more productively. So the gain from IVR deflection is that you can do easier and more cost effective self service, since you need to hand off to expensive agents only at a later stage.

It has been financed amongst others, AWS, Microsoft and individual investors, and is deemed as a serious competitor to Google\u2019s search engine\n, about to be integrated into Bing\n. Many of our customers ask Expertflow whether ChatGPT can be used for customer service. Expertflow CX is AI-agnostic and enables companies to integrate AI engines both for speech and for chat, such as chatbots, speech recognition, Natural Language Understanding, Voice and Face biometrics or toxic language detection to customer service solutions. AI engines can be used for self-service (such as chatbots or conversational IVR) or for agent assistance to provide answers and suggested actions to the agent. These AI engines include Amazon Lex, Rasa, Microsoft Cognitive Services, perspective API and others. So the short answer is \u2013 yes, ChatGPT can be integrated with Expertflow\u2019s Hybridchat solution\n, including embedding into a Contact Center through the open Chatbot API\n. Expertflow would then connect to any chat channel (Whatsapp, Viber, SMS, FB Messenger,\u2026), Social media. It could also use ChatGPT as a conversation engine when combined with a speech recognition engine, to act as a conversational IVR or agent-assist solution. Do we recommend companies to do so for customer service? No, for the time being, for the following reasons: ChatGPT knows only the public internet. It has no access to company- internal data and therefore doesn\u2019t know a company\u2019s products and services, customers, and prices. Customer service is all about these. As long as ChatGPT doesn\u2019t provide data ingestion from company-internal knowledge bases such as with Amazon Kendra\n, Microsoft Cognitive Search and others, ChatGPT will not be able to answer any of these questions. Customers typically have precise use cases, such as price requests, ordering, updates on a ticket, and changes/ updates on an order. This means that the activities that a customer executes typically require a back-office integration to a company\u2019s ERP, CRM, ticketing, online shop or other line-of-business solution. Access to these internal sensitive API\u2019s available in a controlled way resulting in a coherent customer experience. Customers require correct answers or actions to their tickets, problems, and order. This can\u2019t be an answer or action that sounds correct \u2013 it has to be correct and reliable, so they must initially be curated by human beings. Firm answers or actions that sound correct but are factually wrong would undermine customer confidence. Some companies, such as AirAsia\n, have completely dropped customer service in favour of AI. AI has a strong role to play in reducing costs and increasing the availability and reach of customer service. However, Expertflow thinks that the human element will never go away completely. There is always a certain portion of queries that require emotional elements, real-life experience or access to company-internal, access to experts or having a certain cultural background. Expertflow\u2019s portfolio has therefore been to embrace AI technologies in a way that allows seamless hybrid blending of AI and humans in conversations. This approach allows companies to adopt AI technologies gradually without disruptive forklift changes.", "metadata": {"source": "13 post_source ", "title": "Is ChatGPT suitable for Customer Service?", "link": "https://www.expertflow.com/blog/chat-gpt-customer-service/", "post_number": "1", "hour_of_update": "1", "minute_for_update": "3"}}, {"page_content": " WebRTC enables customers to contact companies securely with encrypted voice-or video calls and screen-sharing sessions via a simple web browser or a mobile app. A payable landline or GSM connection is no longer required. Similarly, contact center agents don\u2019t need to install a softphone or plugin to receive phone calls. They can log in to a browser and serve clients via chat, voice, video, and screen share. The open WebRTC standard is supported by Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla and comes with a broad ecosystem to adapt to enterprise customer needs. WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and Amazon Chime use it. Expertflow supports WebRTC as a customer- or agent-facing channel. New features provided to customers that are not available with traditional SIP phones include: No need to installToll-free OTT calling to customer service Video calling Screenshare with screen real-estate (such as pwd fields) that can be masked Multi-channel conversations (chat plus voice, chat plus video, visual IVR, metadata transfer,\u2026) Registration of multiple mobile devices for one customer Website New Capabilities Voice/ video and screen sharing are new capabilities of a website.

Companies wish to evolve their traditional IVR solutions that still use DTMF touch-tone to capture customer input. Instead they would like customers to be able to speak with the IVR. This blog explains the various technologies that can be used in this context: Keyword spotting Keyword spotting means detecting a defined keyword within spoken text. So if the keyword is \u201ccar\u201d, and the spoken sentence is \u201c\nMy car\u2019s license plate is AB789CG\n\u201c, then the result would be positive. If the user says \u201c\nMy vehicle\u2019s license plate is AB789CG\n\u201c, then it wouldn\u2019t recognize it, as the exact word \u201ccar \u201d is not recognized \u2013 so you would end up with many false negatives. If the user says \u201c\nmy card is an Ace\n\u201c, might be positive, as \u201ccard\u201d sounds similar to \u201ccar\u201d. If the keyword is \u201cBee\u201d, it would also be positive, as the \u201cB\u201d is spoken in the same way as \u201cBee\u201d. Both scenarios are false positives Speech Recognition Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) transcribes the entire text of a spoken sentence. In the above example, the user could say \u201c\nI would like to insure my car that has the license plate umm, AB seven hundred eighty nine B G\n\u201c, or he could say \u201c\nI would like to insure my car with plate is AB seven eight nine CG\n\u201c. For a human being, both sentences are equivalent, but the an ASR would not return the same result. The ASR might also return as a result such as \u201c\nI would like to insure my car with plate A bee seven eight nine see gee\n\u201c, as we haven\u2019t told the ASR what to expect. ASR engines integrate to an IVR system through the MRCP protocol Speech Grammars A speech grammar is a function of speech recognition, where you can tell the ASR engine what to expect. In our example, you could say that a license plates corresponds to \u201cletter/ letter/ number/ number/ number/ letter/ letter\u201d. With a speech grammar, the result of any of the sentences above would always result to be \u201c\nI would like to insure my car with plate AB789CG\n\u201c, independently of how it\u2019s spoken. So it speech grammars will eliminate the \u201cumm\u201d, \u201cah\u201d, \u201cbee\u201d, \u201cgee\u201d, \u201csee\u201d from the ASR but correctly replace this with B/ G/ C . Speech grammars are essential if you would like to recognize structured content, such as sequences of numbers and letters (such as ID\u2019s, account numbers, amounts, license plates and the like). It\u2019s also essential if you would like to recognize dates, currencies. You can also define your own vocabularies such as cities (in a country), Last Names, First Names, Road names\u2026 . The better your speech grammars are defined, the higher the recognition rate will be. For example, if you tell a grammar to recognize a first name, and the user says \u201cmy name is Paris Hilton\u201d, then the word \u201cParis\u201d would be interpreted as \u201cFirstname\u201d, and not as the city \u201cParis\u201d. Another example is \u201cI see a bee\u201d (ie, I see a flying insect). With a speech grammar such as \u201cletter, letter, letter, letter\u201d, this would be recognized as \u201cICAB\u201d. A standard for Speech Grammars is SRGS. Natural Language Understanding NLU is used both in chatbots and conversational IVR\u2019s. An NLU is capable of recognizing intents and entities. In the above example, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the user says \u201cmy car\u201d or \u201cmy vehicle\u201d or \u201cmy Audi\u201d doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it is all an object of the type \u201ccar\u201d. An intent is what a user wants to do. So whether a users would say \u201cI want to provide coverage for my car\u201d or \u201cI would like to insure my care\u201d, or \u201cI would like to get an insurance policy for my car\u201d or \u201cI would like to get a car policy\u201d would all yield the same result, which is the intent to get an insurance. The advantage of NLU is that companies don\u2019t need to anticipate all possible ways of saying things \u2013 this is being done by the NLU engine. Voice Biometrics Voice biometrics take an audio \u201cfingerprint\u201d of a user, and then compare spoken speech of users with the fingerprints it has on record to verify whether a user is who he claims to be, based on the sound, speed, rhythm, frequency distribution etc of our individual voices. AI (artificial intelligence) or not? Artificial Intelligence and neural networks are frequently used to detect the above meanings in spoken or typed text. The advantage of these is that they are very versatile and can be continuously updated and improved with additional data samples. The downside is that they are usually more CPU or GPU intensive as they require more processing power and might be slower than traditional explicit speech models that use things such as hidden Markov Chains and Fourier Transformations for speech. Expertflow Expertflow has an extensive experience with a series of cognitive tools such as Spacy, PerspectiveAPI, Microsoft Cognitive Services, NLTK, rasa, Google Dialogflow, IBM Watson, Sestek, Duckling , and specialized Data science engineers fluent in Python and neural networks. We understand the pro\u2019s and cons of each technology, and in which scenario which technology makes most sense.

Expertflow has been in the middle of this partnership, winning the first joint Cisco-Google sponsored developer award in 2018\n. We have deployed in this space multiple Hybrid Chat projects with Cisco UCCE and started deploying Virtual Assistant projects using the new Customer Voice Portal CVP 12.5 Customer Voice assistance CVA node that is available in a Cisco dcloud demo. Cisco CVP with the CVA node and Dialogflow works very well, and Google\u2019s Automated Speech Recognition is doing a fantastic job. Google Dialogflow NLU is a bit limited in that it only provides one intent. Conversation management is only possible with the concept of Contexts\n. On projects, we saw that this way of dialogue management is sufficient for very simple structured dialogues or demos, but they quickly break down when a customer goes outside of a happy path. We tried working around these limitations by storing conversation states in a database, but conversation flows tend to become too complex and difficult to manage. A view to our Customer Interaction Architecture gives us a hint what an alternative might be: For more complex scenarios and multiple-turn dialogues we are using an alternative dialogue engine, in this case Rasa Core. The choice of the dialogue engine also depends on the vertical environment, languages, etc. so there\u2019s not one-size-fits-all. Dialogues are not explicitly hard-coded but are based on many sample stories. These stories can learn over time to handle many different scenarios, and usually don\u2019t require explicit programming. We use Cisco Virtual Voice Browser as an entry point, manage the conversation with Cisco CVP VXML Call Server, hand off individual sentences to Google Dialogflow for ASR and NLU detection, and then feed the\u00a0recognized intents and entities to a conversation engine that is capable to handle more complex multi-turn conversations. Alternative deployment models would be to use alternative Speech engines for languages that are not supported by Google Speech, or where cloud solutions are not an option. There are multiple alternatives also for the NLU layer that can be finetuned to a bespoken language model. A tweak is to set the Recognize.singleUtterance from parameter to TRUE for the rasa feature (because you would like to hand off control to Dialogflow only to recognize an utterance of the customer, revert back with recognized text, and then play it back to CVP, which can then invoke a third-party NLU. Finally and most importantly: By allowing Expertflow CIM to capture these individual steps, data becomes accessible and transferable between multiple AI engines, and selected agent activities can serve as tagging information to train the AI engines. AI engines will thereby learn based on real-world dialogues.", "metadata": {"source": "26 post_source ", "title": "Conversational IVR using Cisco CVP and CVA with Google Dialogflow", "link": "https://www.expertflow.com/blog/conversational-ivr-using-cisco-cvp-and-cva/", "post_number": "1", "hour_of_update": "1", "minute_for_update": "3"}}, {"page_content": "Looking for an alternative to Intercom, Tawk, Livechat, Purechat or Liveperson?

Hybrid Email is an additional channel to the existing Hybridchat/ Customer Interaction solution. The architecture is the same as for the existing Hybrid Chat (HC) solution, which won a global developer award from Google and Cisco in 2019, and has been in production with several clients around the world since 2018. HC and CIM are described under http://www.expertflow.com/customer-interaction/ and http://www.expertflow.com/chat/ , respectively. Documentation and user guides can be found on docs.expertflow.com . CIM is a framework to \u2026 Track all interactions of a customer through any channel (Browsing, Chat/SMS, Calls, Emails, \u2026) Analyze any activity (spoken or written sentence) with any AI engine, extract content and provide meaningful responses or suggestions Initiate either from the agent or customer side multiple interactions over several channels in parallel What sets Hybrid Email apart from other EMRS (Email Response Systems) are the following points Free choice of the NLU (Natural Language Understanding) engine being used \u2013 pre-integrated integrations include IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Microsoft LUIS, rasa.ai and Spacy Most components are shared with Hybrid Chat and the Customer Interaction framework, which has the following advantages Simpler administration, SSO, LDAP integration Use the same AI technologies and data models across all channels (Chat, Email, Web Browsing, Calls), and not only one or two channels Possibility for the agent to combine multiple media (chat, call, third party co-browsing) during the same interaction Tight Cisco Contact Center integration for Routing Agent identities and skills Reporting with Cisco CUIC Unified agent interface in the form of a Cisco Finesse gadget PCI-DSS and EU GDPR compliant on-premise storage of customer data Open data model and API\u2019s for all objects on docs.expertflow.com Integrates with existing antivirus tools, dedicated DMZ treatment of attachments Cloud-native autoscaling and continuous improvements directly to the on-prem installation, using Docker and optionally also Kubernetes and CI/CD with Jenkins or Gitlab Features inherited from the Hybridchat and CustomerInteraction products SSO, User Mgmt, Departments, Tenants, LDAP synchronization of both agents and customers Ability to use third-party AI engines to execute for example the following functions Regex (Regular Expressions, such as credit cards, passwords,\u2026) parsers such as Duckling to detect and remove sensitive content, Choice of a variety of NLU\u2019s to extract intents/ entities from a msg, modify/ translate a msg, and add information to the interaction object, which can then influence routing Spell checking Receive, display and add attachments \u2013 Antivirus, maximum size (both in- and outbound msgs), display images in email or not.

Channel-agnostic interaction management The process described here is already available for Hybrid Chat and will be adapted for the email channel. Independently of the media (email, chat, call,..), the sequence is the following: When a new interaction starts, this creates an initial activity with new non-permanent user data that is not yet in CIM. This can, for example, be information from a form that was filled. This activity also can also contain a link to non-text media of a certain type, such as documents, images, videos. The activity is then sent to configurable AI engines for pre-processing, such as: NLU pre-processing, with suggested activities Regex filtering (Credit Card, Passwords, other sensitive information that should not be shown to an agent; In a CV scenario this could be suppression of pictures, sex, names to avoid racial/ sexual bias) Moving attachments to a DMZ for pre-processing by an external antivirus The extracted information (confidence score, intents, entities, content,\u2026) is then written into the same original activity. Based on this analysis and previous information, the routing engine then takes this information to decide what to do, based on Confidence score by the AI engines Agent availability Calendars Customer Information and profile (email address, tags, lists,\u2026) Past customer profile Required skill and skill level Whether an existing interaction is already taking place with that customer over another channel Results can be a combination of the following Auto-answering Routing to an agent of a certain skill set.

Out-of-the-box connectors other than Google Dialogflow exist for IBM Watson, Microsoft LUIS or rasa.ai. It can run entirely on-premise, so no customer data leaves the company\u2019s premises. It works both on CCE and on CCX (Answer Service for chat only works with CCX Socialminer Chat, not for CCE) HC is able to auto-answer in chat, if and when the confidence score of the AI engine is high. This offloads agents in all standard situations, without requiring the agent to take any manual action. Human agents are only required if and when the AI engine is stuck. HC can integrate with any external third-party knowledge base/ article collection (such as Sharepoint or others). HC can embed also in environments where Finesse is not the agent front-end, for example, a CRM connector. Like Answer Service, Hybridchat can work\u2026 with Google Dialogflow alongside Socialminer Chat \u2026be used for voice \u2013 if an ASR (speech recognition engine) is added to the solution.

A real-time use case is to show a call center agent in real-time what an individual user (=customer in a call center environment) is doing on a website while he\u2019s interacting via chat or phone call. Background on Website Tracking with Cisco Contact centers We have seen a significant and intentional shift of interactions from physical presence, phone and video calls to human chat and self-service online interactions. Real-time interactions across multiple media including digital channels such as Email, chat and social media are now well managed with media blending and universal queues such as the UQ API of Socialminer. Agents are in a simple deployment however not aware of which web pages a user visited before he started a call or chat with the contact center, nor which web pages he is visiting during the interaction. This feature used to be available with Altocloud\u2019s user journey tracking solution. As the company has now been acquired by Genesys, this is no longer a strategic option for Cisco Contact centers. Solution Our solution is to link anonymous tags, such as Google Analytics, to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), so that anonymous events can be added to a user\u2019s individual journey. Google Tag Manager (GTM) In most cases, we use the free (\nGTM\n) as tag management solution to capture tags (measurement code fragments for events such as page views, button clicks, form submissions, DOM events such as hover-over and the like). Over the GTM data layer, we are able to share and write information from one tag or cookie to another. GTM runs only in the user\u2019s browser and doesn\u2019t store any data. Data gathered and exchanged from multiple tags via GTM are in most installations forwarded to and stored in Google Analytics. Google Analytics (GA) Google Analytics can store information captured by tags (such as GTM) and present anonymous analytical information on website visits/journey: \u2026 as well as real-time information: GA also has a so-called user explorer that allows to track individual users via the Client ID. A client ID can span across multiple devices or browser sessions: Adding PII (Personally Identifiable Information GA doesn\u2019t allow storage of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) that could potentially be used to identify a particular person. These include for ex a full name, social security number, phone number, email address or similar. This limits the extent to how GA can be used, as PII is exactly what a contact center needs when interacting with a user. PII is also what is required to have a screen-popup with a user profile. To achieve this, we map PII data that identifies a user to an anonymous GA User Id. A complete user journey using CIM Expertflow Customer Interaction Mgmt (CIM\n) is designed to store multiple customer identities (phone numbers, account numbers, FB ID,\u2026) , one of which is a one or several GA User ID\u2019s: With the User ID stored in CIM, CIM is now able to retrieve a particular user\u2019s web activities via the GA User Activity API\n, and add these to the user\u2019s journey. Real-time information to Agent Finesse with The contact center agent will see in his CIM Finesse Gadget any user www activity, including web page views, clicks and others while he is interacting with the customer via calls, chat, emails or any other media. The only requirement is that the user has identified himself once on the web page with one of his identifiers. An anonymous identifier is then inserted via GTM into the GA cookie and GA then stores all activities of that user. The user activities can then be retrieved by CIM via the User Activity API and shown to the agent via his Finesse CIM gadget. Socialminer Chat, ECE Chat, Expertflow Hybrid Chat CIM can be used alongside Socialminer Chat for UCCX or ECE Chat for UCCE/ PCCE. It can either show the customer browsing information in the CIM gadget, or insert it as a message in a special format sent to the agent. Alternatively, CIM can be enhanced with Hybridchat, and chat messages are directly shown within HC/ CIM. GDPR Capturing and storing PII data is subject to the European General Data Protection Rules GDPR). The most sensitive information is, therefore, CIM, which is capable to track and store customer activities. An advantage of CIM is that it allows simple retrieval of all customer interaction data with a single key. It is up to the company using CIM to determine which data they may keep for how long. A general good practice is to store PII information for only a short duration that is necessary to manage one customer ticket, so 1-2 weeks as a rule of thumb. We then suggest permanently storing customer interactions for the sake of Analytics and AI training in an anonymous format, keeping the link between customer identities and interactions, but overwriting PII information. Useful links This video illustrates how User IDs can be mapped to PII information (in a web browser outside of GA). This article describes how an anonymous user identifier can be attached to a Google Analytics UserID.

This new routing mechanism would enhance the existing mediarouting by Expertflow, which currently manages it\u2019s own dedicated Mediarouting domain and interacts with the synchronous routing engine of a contact center. The new feature is that this new async media routing engine continuously predicts anticipated intensity and human work volume for every chat with Machine Learning/ AI, based on the type of unserved recognized intents, the type of media (SMS is slower than FB Chat). It then assigns multiple chats in parallel to agents, ensuring that each agent has the same work volume. If an agent is fully charged, it then makes a synchronous mediarouting request to the contact center to reserve the nextfull-time agent. Conversely, if a chat session becomes a full-time www-collaboration session, all other ongoing chats are given back to the general chat pool and distributed to other agents, and that agent is reserved for the full-time session.

Cubes are used to study and understand what happened, why it happened and what changes should be made in the future. Users are free to have their own use of the cubes they can create their own tables depending on the type of analysis. Beyond these three core cubes, the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) layer of our Business Intelligence solution allows you to add further fields to your data analysis. We have also added two cubes for Call Accounting, so the same tool can be used for internal billing/ accounting to cost centers. Hosted Approach Some of our clients deploy a data warehouse and OLAP viewer solutions on their own servers. This premise-based approach is however very CPU-consuming and costly in terms of server requirements, especially if you don\u2019t run multiple new reports every hour. This cost can be reduced by at least 90% if a hosted approach is chosen, using underlying technologies such as Amazon QuickSight and Redshift, Google BigQuery or Microsoft Azure Data Factory. In this hosted BI approach, your data is continuously encrypted, transferred to the hosted data warehouse, from where you can then run your data warehouse and analytics work. ExpertFlow can make all your customer collaboration data available on hosted data warehouses and OLAP viewers. The functionality is the same as for a premise-based solution.

This provides the same functionality as the Cisco Socialminer Unified Queue API (UQ API) does in UCCE/ PCCE. Why an Alternative to Socialminer? Cisco\u2019s free Socialminer for UCCX provides pull-based media distribution, or limits you to the pre-built Email and chat clients. These are sufficient and good tools for most scenarios. EF Mediarouting for UCCX allows you to build your own email/ chat/ SMS/ video/ media customer-facing interface, route your own media to a CCX agent, and handle the media in a software that can be independent of the Finesse client and/ or Socialminer to manage email, chat or social media, for example Office 365, Gmail, Lotus Notes or Social media tools, such as LivePerson, Kayako, LiveAgent. Use cases While CCX continues to route voice calls as per the Skills and CSQs configured in UCCX, the MediaRouting engine provides routing for non-voice tasks if the agents are not busy on non-voice calls. The notion of \u201cagent\u201d remains the same, whereas the skill groups are in a separate domain. We provide CUIC reports that allow you to see consolidated media reports per agent and skill group. Pre-configured integrations exist for: Chat and Bot frameworks Chat within CRMs such as Siebel, SAP, and Microsoft\n. Web-Video Queuing in a branch office You can also create your own front-ends or gadgets, or have your own applications to request, queue, route and manage interactions. How it works MR Engine keeps an active CTI connection with UCCX for the updated agents\u2019 list with their current state. The Engine makes no impact on the voice MRD and lets CCX engine route voice calls as per the CCX definition of agent skills and CSQs. The MR engine receives a non-voice task such as an email or chat through a REST interface and selects an available CCX agent, who\u2019s not handling a voice call and is the most relevant agent for handling this non-voice task. Once the agent is selected, the Engine reserves the agent (voice not-ready) and assigns the task to the agent. The CCX agent can handle the request either on a Finesse gadget or on a CRM interface such as Siebel, MS CRM, SAP, or others. The agent can transfer, pause and resume the task. Unlike CCX chat & email, MR Engine doesn\u2019t require Cisco SocialMiner for routing of non-voice tasks. CCX engine manages voice-only agent-state information whereas the MR Engine manages agent-state information for all MRDs. An MRD is a channel such as Chat, Email, or SMS. For all voice calls, routing is done by UCCX and the MR Engine is being updated by the voice state information. For Chat requests, the Chat Connector receives external chat requests and the MR Engine routes the chat to one of the available CCX agents. For email requests, the Email Connector receives new email requests and the MR Engine routes the email to one of the available CCX agents. CUIC reports consolidate voice and non-voice media per agent or Skillgroup. Agent Selection For Non-Voice Tasks The MR Engine selects an available agent based on the following criteria. Select the best available agent based on the longest available algorithm matching the MR Engine agent selection criteria. Change the agent state to NOT_READY for voice calls (with a particular media reason) Route the media request Upon finishing the request handling, change the agent state back to READY (to make him available to receive voice calls again) Note: Only one queue per channel is available with the agent selection algorithm based on \u201clongest available\u201d in the READY state. Precision Queue MR Engine relies on Precision queues. You can dynamically map the precision queues to direct a call to the agent who best matches the non-voice task\u2019s precise needs. With the MR Engine, you can: Create attributes. Attributes are characteristics with a boolean flag or a Proficiency rating from 1 to 10. Assign attributes to CCX agents on the MR Engine configuration interface. Create precision queues. Create Expressions and Steps while creating Precision Queues. CCX agents become members of the precision queues automatically based on their attributes. For instance, A precision queue requires an agent who is fluent in French and is proficient in dealing with high priority trouble tickets. An agent Sara is assigned attributes English = True and Trouble-tickets > 7. The engine will select Sara for such tasks if there\u2019s no other free agent with a proficiency beyond 7 in Trouble-tickets. Priority Customer Routing MR Engine handles priority customer routing in support of the CC Admin Caller List module. The Caller List module allows managing repetitive, malicious/hoax Customers or Gold/Silver customers. For more information about the Caller List module, visit Caller Lists Caller Lists may be created manually by the application user and may also be synchronized with the 3rd party CRM solution. How does Priority Routing work? The MRD Connector (Chat, Email) receives a new task. The MRD connector verifies the customer priority label from CC Admin Caller Lists module. If the customer is a member of a priority list, the label is passed along with the task to the MR Engine. The task with the priority label assigned will be inserted to the priority MR Queue. The MR engine always checks the priority queue for any new task to be routed. If there\u2019s no task in the priority queue, tasks from the regular queue will be selected. Agent Interface For the agent interface, MR Engine allows both a Finesse gadget front-end and an embedded CRM Connector. Finesse Gadget Frontend The Engine supports open RESTful API for asynchronous communication with a 3rd party Finesse gadget. CRM Connector All the task handling including accept, reject, pause, resume, and handling of the non-voice tasks such as Email and Chat will be handled directly from the embedded CRM interface. The MR Engine has planned to provide embedded adaptors for MS Dynamics CRM on-premise and 365, and Oracle Siebel. Using the MR Adaptor SDK, adaptors for other CRM solutions may be developed. Redundancy/Failover MR Engine currently supports single server deployment with a single point of failure. However, it supports integration with UCCX cluster deployment. MR Engine Dependencies The Engine requires, Supervisor Tools Team Administration Module for seamless integration with CCX components and configuration synchronization. Customer Interaction (CIM) Caller Lists module for handling Priority Customers MR Engine doesn\u2019t require Cisco SocialMiner. The Engine integrates directly with UCCX APIs, Finesse REST APIs, and XMPP. For Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX), Enterprise (UCCE or PCCE).

In a recent blog\n, we showed how contact center technology and our retail queue solution can be used to queue visitors to a branch office, and provide queuing not only to agents but also to video endpoints in the branch office. Especially in smaller branches, the POS (point of sales). queuing devices such as thermal printers to print out queue ticket numbers, tablets etc are costly and are often an issue for maintenance (fixing the POS printer etc). Mobile apps are now being used to allow customers to queue, but this would require visitors to first download a mobile app, which many might be reluctant to do. With Expertflow Hybridchat\n, customers can use their existing Chat client (Whatsapp, FB Messenger, SMS,\u2026) as a way to queue in a branch office. The chatbot will queue them, and do initial information capturing for that customer. The chatbot is also capable to send queuing position, queuing time, can share location updates via GPS if the customer allows to do so. It can also schedule appointments with specific persons and plan the topics to be discussed, and send updates about the meeting. When the customer finally reaches the bank officer, a screen-popup with the interaction history via chat becomes available to the serving officer. The advantage of queuing via chat is that it is available entirely without any physical queuing device and without customers having to install anything on their mobile phone.

This page illustrates a proof of concept retail queuing solution that we built in 2016, using Cisco UCCX, PCCE, UCCE contact centers to queue customers in a retail branch, and providing virtual services for clients in these branches as well. Traditional queuing solutions print out a ticket for specific service requests with anonymous queuing. Our retail queue solution goes beyond that and provides a single virtual queue across all branches and Cisco Contact Center, allowing Customer Service Representatives (CSR\u2019s) to serve clients not only physically, but also through Video Terminals, and to do personalized queuing based on the visitor\u2019s profile. The video example here shows how queuing is done by a virtual CSR, and customers are then served in a cubicle in the background or by in-person CSR\u2019s in a dedicated booth. Queuing can however also happen with traditional ticket printers or touchscreens. When branch A is very busy, and branch B has free CSR\u2019s, then CSR\u2019s from branch B can serve clients in branch A through voice or video call. Customer Identification: Mobile App, Tablet, Picture, Printer A visitor can identify himself for queuing by using a tablet, touchscreen, browser in the branch, by entering an identification such as his account or mobile number, entering a name, swiping his bank card \u2013 which will then allow more sophisticated and personalized queuing/ routing. The same effect can be achieved if customers use a mobile app for queuing. Alternatively and for non-identified customers as in a traditional approach of a printed-out ticket can be used, or customers could queue with their pictures that are taken by the queuing computer. If one can assume that most customers have a mobile device, then a mobile app or chat client can be used. This replaces a physical on-site queuing device (thermo-printer,..), that is normally expensive and maintenance-heavy especially in small branches. Proof of concept in 2016 with a self-built POS printer. Today, we would work with off-the-shelf POS printers.. Overhead screens guide visitors to service counters The visitor queue number (or Name or picture, or last digits of a mobile or account number), as well as counter he should go to are displayed on Expertflow Wallboard\n, so the customer knows which counter he should visit. Additionally, estimated waiting times for new customers may be displayed. The display can either be plugged into one of the client terminals or a low-cost standalone computer can be used to feed the display. CSR interface to receive next visitor The CSR\u2019s can show their readiness for the next customer by finishing the ongoing task on their CTI client, which can be Cisco Finesse or the CRM CTI Interface\n. If agents use a CRM interface and if the client is identified while he is queued by entering his account/ mobile number or name, the agent will see the customer profile pop up in the CRM while the customer walks to his counter as shown in this video. Advantages over traditional queuing solutions Statistics and queue times are managed and consolidated centrally both for the contact center and the branches, with the possibility to do drill-downs, for example, to see all interactions of a customer across all channels. Workforce Management/ Staffing based on traffic forecast can be done both for the contact center and for individual branches. Callcenter technologies such as customer identification (card reader, account number,..), screen-popup in the CRM, and self-service on a Video IVR can be deployed once and used both in branches and the contact center.

Visual IVR from Cisco CVP You can use Cisco CVP to implement your Visual IVR logic. We provide special CVP nodes that generate both VXML and HTML code: This means that CVP will act both as an IVR and as a chatbot at the same time.

All new Expertflow software is now being deployed in Docker Containers on Linux or Windows Machines\n. The advantage as compared to Virtual Machines on VMWare is that individual instances don\u2019t each require an operating system. The footprint is much lower, and new instances can be started in seconds rather than in minutes. So whenever an instance fails, a new instance will be spawned within seconds, which is noticeable in most use-cases. Basic installation is done with Docker Compose files\n, as illustrated here for Hybrid Chat\n. If multiple servers are required, this is managed by Docker Swarms or Kubernetes. This also takes care of auto-scaling, failover, and healing. Our normal deployment model is simple Docker Swarms: For larger deployments or clients that already have a private cloud with a proper CI (Continous Integration)/ CD (Continuous Deployment/ DevOps environment, we support Kubernetes, currently with either the Redhat Openshift, Google Kubernetes, or Rancher flavors. Looking forward, we plan to use CaaSi to provide cloud solutions. CaaSi stands for container as a service for ISVs (Independent Software Vendors). The cloud can be a public cloud (Amazon AWS, Google GCP, Microsoft Azure, Digitalocean\u2026), or your private cloud. We will then continuously update the containers on your cloud using a CI/CD solution such as Jenkins or Gitlab. These docker containers are accessing data that resides on a database that can reside on your premises: This blog on Venturebeat describes advantages to this approach: So this is how Expertflow provides SaaS/ Cloud services. Timing as to when is largely driven by concrete customer demand. We will initially make available our Software on a customer-per-customer base, but then gradually start to directly extend our CI/ CD pipeline to customers on-prem or pure cloud instances for clients that wish this approach.

The primary use of Artificial Intelligence in customer care is to recognize what is being said or written predict what the next appropriate action should be, and either automatically respond to the client or assist the human contact center agent The first point is provided with solutions such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the later by dialog engines that either work with human scripted dialogues or machine-learning dialogues. Expertflow believes that AI algorithms that provide such functionalities are rapidly evolving and are replaceable. The common requirement for any AI engine and the actual treasure is tagged data for a particular customer context, which is very labor-intensive. Tagged company-owned data in the form of tagged speech (transcribed text), tagged messages (intents and entities), and tagged dialog sequences is the treasure that helps you uncover. We are the mining company of AI \u2013 we don\u2019t provide data, we don\u2019t process data, but we give you access to it. AI use cases AI technologies can be used in several customer care situations, the main ones being described here. NLU to extract intents and entities from written text (chat/ email/ documents) or speech Dialogue management determines the next appropriate action or response. Dialogue management maintains a conversation state and context. It can also capture slots to be filled that are required to fulfill a certain action. Dialogue management can also interact with a CRM to extract more information about a customer or his past interactions, and use this information to drive the conversation. Speech technologies\n, such as ASR, to recognize utterances of a speaker, or Voice Biometrics, to identify that a voice fingerprint matches a speaker\u2019s registered voice. can also be used to do automated screen-popup on the customer advisor tablet or call center agent desktop to bring up the right information on the screen without any human intervention \u2013 just based on speech. Indicate to a call center agent in real-time the probability that the speaker is who he pretends to be Image and Optical Character recognition \u2013 Extract text and content of images from printed documents, Data Analytics \u2013 Recognize patterns in customer behavior, generate customer profiles and clusters Alternatives to AI The above-mentioned goals can also be achieved without neural networks. These are typically grammar-based/ scripted approaches. Some technologies are Hidden Markov Chains, Lemmatizers, TF-IDF, Bag-Of-Words. For the conversation part, this corresponds to scripted (such as in an IVR script) engines. They don\u2019t require large amounts of data, bring immediate results, but can\u2019t learn from real ongoing conversations, so the success rate eventually tapers off. The illustrative diagram below shows the typical success rate of two chatbots dialog engines using either an AI or an alternative approach: One using a purely scripted approach (blue), one using a pure machine learning approach (red). The scripted chatbot will immediately achieve positive results but will struggle to learn in the long run. machine-learning-based bots will have disappointing initial results but then continue to learn over time with more samples. We see that by combining the results of both approaches (yellow), we will achieve both immediate results and long-term learning. The diagram illustrates that initially, 50% of all chat conversations will require an escalation to a human agent (green). This percentage will then decrease over time, as the chatbot\u2019s answer capabilities (yellow) increase. A promising approach is to combine at least three elements, all working in parallel: a scripted/ grammar based engine for immediate results a machine-learning engine for ongoing learning a human agent to capture any situation that is not recognized by the algorithms Expertflow CIM normalizes inputs and outputs of AI and other signal extraction engines and blends these with human agents. Algorithms are replaceable, data is not AI systems take a labeled data vector as an input and then create a model that will allow labeling/ classification of future input. Input can, for example, be speech or text utterances, and labels could be recognized entities or intents. Whereas in traditional programming, one applied known rules do data to get answers, AI takes data and answers (= labels to the data) to find a model/ rules. Diagram (Google I/O \u201818) Most of the effort when using AI work is related to data collection and labeling. Building a neural network (NN) model takes a few lines of code. Training the NN, evaluating it and doing predictions is taking one line of code each: One-line code sample on training a NN in KERAS: model\n.fit(\ndata\n, labels\n, epochs=\n10\n, batch_size=\n32\n) One-line code sample on predicting from a NN with KERAS: prediction = predict(\nself\n, x, batch_size= , verbose=\n0\n, steps= ) Tools such as Tensorboard allow you to test multiple types of NN\u2019s and models on your data with changing hyperparameters (number of layers, training rates, convolutions,\u2026), in order to empirically find the best NN for your data: For most use cases that are interesting for contact centers (speech recognition, phoneme recognition, voice biometrics, NLU, customer profiling,\u2026), there exist good Github images with Jupyter/ Python Models of models that are appropriate for a certain problem, using open-source NN libraries such as KERAS or Tensorflow. Combining this with the fact that the best models are models that are built with your own data, and that new scientific publications occur very frequently means that one can expect to end up with the best results not by using static commercial algorithms and software, but to be ready to continuously improve the model\n, and to invest effort instead to capture and label data, as well as to think on how to deploy these gained models into a productive environment. So the right question is not \u201c\nwhat is the best algorithm\n?\u201d (as this will continuously change), but \u201c\nhow do I extract my data, and what do I do with predictions?\n\u201d. Training data with sensitive data Customer data (on the right in the below diagram) is sensitive, and developers (or Expertflow) should not have any access to the same. Developers can build data connectors for data conversion and build promising models in a dev environment, using a small set of test data. These connectors and models can then be exported to a production environment, where multiple models can then be tested and evaluated. The results of the same are then returned to the dev environment: There are some situations where it is necessary for debugging to visualize data on prod data, especially if results from prod and dev data differ widely. One approach to this might be to use data sterilization as mentioned later. Expertflow extracts data and embeds your models in a contact center \u201cProductive environment\u201d in our environment means a contact center with human agents, routing, CRM,\u2026 This is where Expertflow provides expertise, as the way and formats of how data is stored are very similar amongst our clients: We help companies extract data (speech and screen recordings, chat history/ transcripts, email history, document storage, CRM information, Call center data,\u2026). We enrich the data, for example with call tags and customer data. We then convert data (either in a static format or as a stream) in an NN-optimized format ( for example in TensorFlow-optimized TFRecord), which allows you to easily test and build your own models. We then use your best model (which can evolve over time) to assist humans (= contact center agents) in the contact center or to fully automate certain services (self-service/ web-service). So our approach is that your predictive models will gradually learn and improve over time. Company-specific data sets increase performance Companies usually have their own slang, vocabulary, use case and dialogues. Models that are trained with actual real samples from that company will always outperform a general-purpose system. This also means that the best and cheapest way to increase the performance of a NN is to feed it more data specific to the actual use case. Not making use of this treasure of data is a waste. Expertflow believes that a key to a long-term successful AI strategy is to store and curate (tag) your own data and models, whatever the tools are used. Data should be available/ exportable in a form that can be shared with any AI solution there might be. Extract training data with agent tags What the human contact center agent does can be a tag for what the customer said or wrote. These can be the following: An answer written or selected by the agent in a chat call tags to classify an entire call Capturing actions that agents take in the CRM or agent guidance/ forms Capturing the agent\u2019s browser actions via DOM events This tagging information can be used to tag a specific chat message speech At the very least, these initial tags can be used to group similar events, which will then allow for more focused manual supervised training in a second step, rather than having to go through endless data. This approach can accelerate the generation of training data for neural networks. This feedback loop/ tagging is illustrated on the left of the below CIM diagram. Predicting next actions based on customer journeys Expertflow CIM groups customer activities into interactions. A sequence of activities is a predictor of the next appropriate chatbot or agent action. By feeding a sequence of actions to a Recurrent Neural Network, the next appropriate action can be determined. An example of such an approach in the Chatbot space is Rasa Core\n, which is trained with \u201csample stories\u201d (= customer journeys) consisting of \u201cmessages\u201d (= activities). This can be generalized to include activities across any media (voice, website navigation history, call tags, forms, chats,\u2026) as a message. Expertflow\u2019s goal is to capture any activity occurring in the contact center so that companies can build their own dialog model across any channel. Use AI engines across all channels It makes sense to build AI models once, and leverage them across all channels. For example, whether a customer says or chats \u201cI want to change my address\u201d, the resulting actions should be the same, and therefore the dialog/ conversation engine should be the same. Similarly, the NLU layer to extract the intents and entities from \u201cI want to change my address\u201d is the same whether this is spoken, written as a chat message, or in a letter, the meaning is the same. Therefore it makes sense to use the same NLU engine across document management, internal search engines, email analysis, document analysis, chat message analysis. The wider the use case, the more data will be available and the better and faster a good model will be trained. Vertical AI using large input vectors It is likely that at some point, AI models will not be limited to one use case or one media only. It might be possible to have a neural network whose unique input vector includes both speech, text or images. The input layers would be different for each media, but the subsequent layers might be in common. Toda already, speech recognition has a higher performance when combined with an NLU (which tries to make sense of what was said from the text). One can conclude that combining this with a conversation engine (which tries to put everything in context based on what was previously said) will further increase recognition rates. Vendor independence Vendors that are active in the areas of CRM, bots, CC, Chat solutions often offer their own proprietary cloud-based chat or bot solution, that can only be used with that particular platform. Expertflow believes that an ideal solution provides open interfaces to any CRM, Bot, CC or chat solution. Introduce AI gradually Our approach is as follows: Initially, all conversations happen between humans only. One might, however, choose to position any chat towards a client as a \u201cbot\u201d, even if humans are responding in a Wizard-Of-Oz fashion. This will avoid wrong expectations and disappointments should a bot respond indeed. Humans will always an in all stages act as a safety net when AI fails to in a conversation AI supports all human interactions by suggesting and facilitating the best actions. This can start with certain channels only (chat, email), but the ultimate goal should be to cover all interactions (voice, video, retail branch..) AI should monitor and learn from each human interaction (text and voice), and continuously build a stock of valid conversations, interactions and actions. This learning is initially entirely supervised with manual tagging, but can gradually become semi-supervised or unsupervised tagging. This learning is a continuous, perpetual process, as all companies will evolve in their products and services. This continued learning is the reason why an AI/ data driven approach is appropriate: it can learn implicitly on valid interactions without requiring an explicit (human-) programmed processes. If and where AI is sufficiently confident that it has recognized context, intent, and entities from a customer utterance/ email/ letter, AI can be enabled to respond autonomously without human interaction, or to respond after a certain delay if a human agent hasn\u2019t responded. This means that AI is introduced gradually and continuously in support of human interactions. AI has to first prove it\u2019s worthiness before being allowed to interact autonomously. There is no \u201cnow we do AI\u201d big-bang project as some examples have shown\n. What Expertflow provides CIM is a framework capable of tracking activities from multiple sources, that allows you to embed any AI engine for certain purposes. You own the data, and you can change the AI algorithms at any point in time. An example use case is Hybrid Chat, and we plan to provide similar vendor-agnostic integrations also for voice, Emails and written communication. Blending media What you can already do with CIM is to blend multiple media, for example: Run a voice and chat (SMS, FB Messenger, Whatsapp,\u2026) campaign, triggered and controlled via an API from your Marketing or CRM tool Start a chat or chatbot from a voice call Trigger a voice call from a chat Run surveys after calls via SMS or voice, controlled or handoff to a chatbot dialogue.

This blog describes the disadvantages of not integrating. The Erlang C formula tells us that having a small group of agents (one group for chat, one group for voice) serving one media only will result in long waiting times and low productivity. If we don\u2019t use the legacy infrastructure of the contactcenter, we are forgoing many acquired benefits, resulting in a administrative overhead (agent management, skills definition, reports,\u2026) It is ok to start small POC\u2019s and pilots with new channels, but such channels will become genuinely profitable only when they are fully integrated with a contact center. Erlang C The Erlang C formula suggests two things for customer care: Group agents and contact centers together wherever possible. Small units will always result in low productivity and long waiting times. Even small decreases in processing time will reduce waiting time and increase productivity. => Almost all contact center technologies are working on either one of these two points to improve customer service. The Erlang C formula (Wikipedia) says that the waiting time for customers decreases proportionally with the number of agents and productivity of agents, and increases proportionally to the handle time. The graphic below shows the waiting time for a customer with the productivity per agent (number of minutes per hour in talking state) being constant. One can see that the waiting time decreases proportionally to the number of agents working in parallel, given a certain agent productivity: Intuitively, one road with four lanes will be able to handle more traffic than four roads with one lane each: It is also the reason why we started seeing single queues for example in post offices, rather than one queue per counter. Having a single queue (aka \u201cSingle Media Routing Domain\u201d) improves customer service. Legacy call center environment Customer care centers have a rich technical legacy and are highly optimized in their processes with specialized software to handle customer requests, such as Agent Identities and Skill sets Media Routing/ Call Distribution (ACD) strategies Business Intelligence (BI) and reporting Workforce Management (WFM) Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Quality Assurance and agent Training (QA) Knowledge base (KB) Marketing and campaign management Agent guidance/ conversation guides Customers expect to be served consistently and seamlessly through various media channels, such as the Website, Voice and Video Calls, SMS, Chat (over a variety of tools such as Facebook Chat, Mobile app Chat, SMS,\u2026), Emails, Documents and retail branches. If a new solution is deployed that doesn\u2019t interface well with these solutions, this means foregoing the reasons why these tools were purchased in the first place, and result in a duplication of administrative effort.

This blog illustrates how we will be implementing mapping customer Identities (FB ID, Skype ID, email, mobile number,\u2026) to agent channels (voice, video, screenshare,\u2026) in CIM. In the CIM server deployment profile, channels and identifiers can be mapped. There are customer identities, customer channels, and agent channels. customer identity to customer channels is an 1:N relationship customer channels to agent channel is an N:1 relationship One customer identity can correspond to multiple customer channels, for example a mobile number identity can correspond to SMS chat, RCS chat or voice call customer channels A Skype customer identity can correspond to either a chat or a voice/ video call channel customer channels A Whatsapp ID can correspond to either a chat or a voice call channel Customer identities might or might not have a presence indicator (typical in messaging such as MS Teams, Whatsapp, FB Messenger, \u2026) One agent channel captures multiple customer channels: Agent chat channel can correspond to WWW cookie Chat, FB Messenger Chat, Skype Chat, SMS Chat Agent voice can correspond to multiple phone number channels, WebRTC Voice, Skype Voice or Whatsapp Voice Agent video can correspond to WebRTC video or to Skype Video Customer scre Agent channels are company-internal channels, and there are few of them, for example: SIP voice and video Chat (Expertflow hybridchat or Cisco ECE chat or Cisco Socialminer Chat or Genesys Chat) A screen sharing or Co-browsing channel Each customer channel requires typically one channel gateway. Expertflow has this currently primarily for chat channels. There might in some cases also be third-party gateways (for ex sipjs.com). The gateway and its state diagram and possible actions are part of an object that is added with each new customer channel. Enduser experience The channel activities for a certain identity are shown whenever a user hovers over that identity (for ex if a customer hovers over a Skype or mobile phone identity, the user can choose to either chat or call, and the chat or call ultimately goes through different agent channels). An end user can only add identities. Identities will always be shown, but what they are capable of depends on which customer and agent channels have been activated. CIM only shows activated channels CIM will only show channels that have\u00a0been activated (connected both to an agent and a customer channel). Showing activated channel capabilities is consistent across all CIM tools. For example, if the outbound campaign manager includes sending SMS or contacting via any chat channel, but there is no SMS or chat channel configured, there will be an alert upon creating campaign. Or: If a customer in the list that will be used for a campaign, the campaign manager will alert the user that this particular user will not be contacted during the campaign.", "metadata": {"source": "48 post_source ", "title": "Mapping Channels with CIM", "link": "https://www.expertflow.com/blog/mapping-channels-cim/", "post_number": "1", "hour_of_update": "1", "minute_for_update": "3"}}, {"page_content": "This blog describes how the award-winning Expertflow Hybridchat (HC) solution can be used if users want to continue using the Cisco ECE or Socialminer Chat. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll only mention ECE here, but by and large the same applies for Socialminer Chat in a UCCX environment. A difference of HC, ECE and Socialminer Chat is here\n. This blog describes in Scenario 2 how HC can be used with ECE without the HC gadget to: add or customize chat channels add chatbots filter inbound and outbound messages to meet PCI-DSS compliance and avoid DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Finally, we describe how a HC gadget can work alongside ECE and what value it adds. What Hybrid Chat (HC) adds to Cisco ECE HC conferences the customer, chatbots and an agent. It shows chatbot provided answers to a human agent within an add-on gadget, and auto-answers if the Chatbot\u2019s confidence score is sufficiently high. The agent continues to chat with Cisco ECE in a separate gadget. Routing, reporting, storage, agent identity management is done by ECE and CCE. Compared to a traditional handoff from a bot to a human \u2013 which only provides Chatbot automation at the beginning of a chat (left side below), HC permanently automates certain elements of conversations throughout the conversation (right side): The two ways how HC can be used alongside ECE are: HC as a second gadget next to the ECE, showing suggested answers and auto-answering during the chat HC as a front-end to interconnect to customer-facing chat channels and chatbots, and then doing a traditional handoff to ECE, no Hybridchat agent gadget Scenario 1: Add-on Hybrichat gadget In this scenario, the HC gadget runs alongside ECE chat gadget. Routing to the agent, reporting and agent identity management is done by ECE. The agent can chat with the customer through ECE. The HC gadget presents chatbot-suggested answers to the agents and displays color-coded confidence scores to the agent. It will also auto-answer after timeouts on behalf of the agent. The agent can click to select one of the alternative HC-provided answers. If the agent starts typing on ECE, the auto-answer timer is stopped. To a large degree, the advantages of Hybridchat are achieved. Switching between chats \u2013 state synchronization Whenever the agent changes focus from one chat to the next in the ECE, the focus changes as well in HC \u2013 both gadgets have state synchronization. Architecture ECE doesn\u2019t allow the creation of agent-originated messages, so HC answers can only be added as customer-originated messages. ECE supports fonts and rich text, which means chatbot-originated messages can be posted on the agent ECE gadget in a separate color \u2013 see the last orange-colored message in the diagram below. To the agent, chatbot-provided answers will appear on the same side as customer messages, but in different formatting. HC decides whether to send agent answers or bot answers. To the customer on the left, both agent or bot-originated messages will look like call center originated messages, so the customer experience is the same. All chat messages between the contact center and the customer will go through HC. HC decides to insert a bot-generated auto-answer after timeout with a certain confidence score. HC also takes care of channel adaptation (Skype, FB Messenger, SMS, Whatsapp,\u2026). Limitations as compared to normal HC Compared to normal hybrid chat with a unified gadget the suggested answers are not shown within the same chat gadget. the agent can only fully accept or reject an answer suggested by the Chatbot, but not modify them an agent can\u2019t write a message to the customer in ECE and easily highlight it as template message to be added to the answers to be suggested by the chatbot looking forward Chatbot control (conversation rollback, tagging,\u2026) is limited Secondary differences are related to the difference of the chat tool (ECE vs hybridchat), such as flexibility of Storage, Access Control Lists, Reporting,\u2026 Scenario 2: Traditional Handoff In this scenario, HC initially handles the chat with the chatbot, interconnects to all chat channels (FB Messenger, SMS, Webchat, Whatsapp,\u2026), and then hands off the conversation permanently to the contact center agent using Cisco ECE Chat. There is no HC Finesse Gadget and no auto-answers during the conversation.

Special thanks to Helvetia, to be the first client to test this new approach on having both their bot and human agents collaborate to serve customers, Massimiliano and the team at Cisco, J\u00fcrgen, Thorsten, Adrian from Bucher & Suter. \u201cWinning this award is amazing. And, being recognized by companies like Cisco and Google for having created useful technology lets us know that we\u2019re working in the right direction.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Andreas Stuber, CEO, Expertflow Our award-winning solution came out of an effort to better integrate bot \u2013 agent functionality as a way of optimizing\u00a0agent resource utilization. Normally, bots have a hard time effectively handling complex customer transactions; inevitably, customers will ask questions the bots can\u2019t answer, which typically has made it necessary for certain classes of transactions to be exclusively agent-based. Our goal was to make it possible for businesses to implement a solution that could utilize both bots and agents in a seamless and highly efficient way. We intend to scale customer service chat throughput by augmenting human input without eliminating it entirely. The architecture marries on-premise Cisco Container Platform for chat interaction with the human contact center agents and the chatbot chat system they use, within Google Cloud Platform/Dialogflow for the Artificial Intelligence engine making the suggested responses. Their solution also showed how a human can use this augmented experience to scale to handle more simultaneous chat conversations while improving response quality without sounding robotic.

It was last updated on September 29th, 2022. Protecting your privacy or the handling and processing of personal data in connection with your visit to our Internet pages is very important to us, and we want you to feel comfortable and secure. We process personal data in accordance with the country\u2019s data protection laws in which the responsible entity is based. This policy applies only to the web presence of ExpertFlow LLC ( hereafter referred to as EF) and not to websites to which links may be provided. Customers / Website Visitors Expertflow collects personal information about its customers offline (business cards) or from visitors to the Expertflow webpages under expertflow.com. It explains what user data we collect through our interactions with you and how we process and use that data. We are committed to protecting your data as we do not allow publishing it or sharing it with third parties and only using personal information in the way described herein. This applies to the website, online shop, forum, ticketing tool, and online documentation, all running under the expertflow.com domains. Collection, processing, and use of data on expertflow.com\nOn our web pages, you may be asked to provide certain information. It may include basic personal information like email address, name and phone number(s), your business requirements or challenges to address, or some primary information about your existing contact center setup. We can retain your personal data and process it on your behalf, to provide you with targeted products and services from Expertflow. On our blog, you may be required to register or to post a comment. No personal data will be shared with third parties other than for legal enforcement or obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements with you. Use of Google Analytics, Adwords, Tags and online Marketing tools We use Google Analytics, Adwords, Tags, Digital Marketing solutions cookies, and similar technologies on our website. We might use tracking code in our emails to help us understand user behavior on our website, conversion tracking, and website traffic analysis and limit spam. We also use online CRM or ticketing tools to process personal information. We either ensure that we host this information on our servers or verify that all software that treats personal information complies with GDPR. The marketing tools described above may insert cookies in your browser after allowing it to do so. You can, at any point in time, use the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d at the bottom right of every website page to remove/ disable them. Newsletter Subscription You need to consent explicitly to our newsletter. If you do so, we will use your email address to inform you about our products, services, or news. You can always revoke your consent by unsubscribing to the newsletters or any email information you are getting from us on your emails. Outside of newsletter subscriptions, we will send you personal 1:1 direct emails if we think a product or service might be relevant to your particular situation. Legal Notice on changes Information provided on our website is subject to constant modification. The changes made over time may also impact our privacy policy. With the modifications in the web content, care has been taken to update the policy consistently.. Reference Statements, Sharing during Projects\nExpertflow asks its clients\u2019 consent explicitly before we mention them as a reference. During ongoing projects, you might be required to share information about yourself with third parties to deliver a project. We keep this information sharing strictly related to the particular project and task at hand. Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) Expertflow has majority-owned subsidiaries outside of the EU that Binding Corporate Rules bind to Expertflow LLC Switzerland. Employees from such subsidiaries might be accessing data from Expertflow's web pages. Switzerland's data protection is deemed equivalent to the EU GDPR. Expertflow applies the stricter regulations of either EU GDPR or Swiss Data privacy laws in case of ambiguities. GDPR - Compliance of Expertflow Software\nThis chapter describes how Expertflow software is designed to comply with GDPR. The only software that Expertflow provides stores customer information is CIM (client interaction management). It stores and manages customer information as configured by the client. The link between an (identified) customer (such as name, first name, address, phone number, email) and any associated information (phone numbers, QA scores, list, interactions,\u2026) is done via keys. The only object that identifies a customer is the customer object itself. It is also possible to keep a customer object bare of any identifying information and to store identifying information in a third-party system (for example, a CRM). Expertflow provides PCI-DSS compliant APIs that allow retrieval and storage of any information related to that particular customer. Expertflow ensures you can access/ view/ modify customer-specific information in a machine-readable format. Expertflow does not store any information about its client\u2019s customers, and any hosting that might be done is under the client\u2019s responsibility. Cloud software Expertflow's cloud/ SaaS software may contain PII information if clients using our SaaS store such information. It is the responsibility of clients using the SaaS to ensure that such PII is used in a GDRP- compliant way. Access to all cloud data is encrypted wherever possible with role-based security keys, meaning that Expertflow does not intentionally have access to PII on our client's customers. Expertflow has direct access to PII about users of the software. GDPR - Client\u2019s Customer Information and System Access Expertflow does not store or edit directly any information about its client (or partner)\u2019s customers. Expertflow clients need to ensure that no remote connection provided to Expertflow engineers provides access to customer information. Expertflow will aim to highlight any breach so that Expertflow employees will have no access to the client\u2019s customer information. Expertflow Employee Data Privacy In sensitive environments, for example, to provide VPN access, our clients or state regulations require a personal security background check of Expertflow employees. Previously to share such information, Expertflow requires a written statement that all such personal data will only be stored for the duration during which access is required and only to secure access. It will not be shared with persons or organizations not relevant for security enforcement and will be kept only for the period during which access is required and one year afterward, after which the data will be deleted. This data is protected under EU GDPR equivalency, including penalties. Collection and Processing of Personal Data Visiting the Expertflow website is generally possible without us requiring personal data from you or setting cookies. However, visiting websites results in servers storing various access data in an electronic log (so-called \"log file\") by default. This data includes, e.g., the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the IP address of your access, the website from which you visit us, and the date and duration of the visit. As a rule, this information does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about you, for example, the data collected during a visit to our website is only recorded anonymously by Expertflow and, if necessary, evaluated for statistical purposes, which only serve to optimize the web pages. Under no circumstances will data be passed on to third parties. Our website may contain links to websites of other providers not covered by this policy, e.g., websites with content, information, and services of third parties over which EF has no control. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of your data are the responsibility of the respective operators. We ask you to refer to their data protection notices for more details and point out that we exclude any liability and responsibility for the data protection provisions of these third-party websites. Why does Expertflow Collect, Store, or Process Data? We collect, store and process data from you on an ad hoc basis, which you generate or enter when using our website or when communicating with us so that we can optimally coordinate our communication with you or our services for you and process your messages or requests. The basis for this is the contact information you provide to us, which may include your personal contact information such as name, email address, phone number, etc., and the corresponding message content. In the case of merely informational use of the website, for example, if you do not register or otherwise transmit information to us, we only collect the personal data your browser transmits to our server. If you wish to view our website, we collect the following data, which is technically necessary for us to display our website to you and to ensure stability and security, IP address Date and time of the request Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) Content of the request (specific page) Access status/HTTP status code Amount of data transferred in each case The website from which the request comes Browser Operating system and its interface Language and version of the browser software Use and Disclosure of Personal Data and Purpose Limitation All personal data collected by EF will be collected, processed, and used following the applicable regulations for protecting personal data only for contract execution, protecting our legitimate business interests, and processing your messages or requests. EF maintains current technical measures to ensure data security, particularly to protect your data against risks during data transmissions and against third parties gaining knowledge. These measures are adapted to the current state of the art. Declaration of Agreement By using our web pages, you agree that the personal data voluntarily submitted by you may be stored by us and processed and used in accordance with this policy. Cookies from Third Parties Cookies from third parties, e.g., Google Analytics, Google Maps, YouTube, Mautic etc., may be used on our website with your consent. Use of Google Analytics\nOur website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\"Google\"). Google Analytics uses \"cookies\", text files placed in your browser, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by a cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server and stored there. IP anonymization is activated on this website. In that case, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within the European Union member states or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activity, and provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. Third-party Provider Information Use of YouTube We also embed the \"YouTube\" software in our information offering, as with many websites. The YouTube software uses cookies for data collection and statistical data analysis. YouTube uses cookies, among other things, to collect reliable video statistics, prevent fraud and improve the user experience. YouTube's embedded videos are used within YouTube's permitted use, which all users must accept. If you see copyrights violated, please report it directly to YouTube. EF uses embedded YouTube videos in extended privacy mode\n. This means that YouTube does not store cookies for a user who views a website with an embedded YouTube video player but does not click on the video to start playback. If the YouTube video player is clicked, YouTube may store cookies on the user\u2019s browser, but no personal cookie information is stored for playbacks of embedded videos. For more details, please refer to YouTube's general privacy policy. We do not collect any personal data as part of embedding YouTube videos. For more information on YouTube's official privacy policy, please visit Privacy Guideline\n. Use of Facebook Our website contains the plug-in of the social network Facebook. This is the button with the Facebook logo. All data processing operations in this context are not done by us but by Facebook. It is unknown exactly which data processing operations Facebook carries out when and after a user calls up a fan page. Therefore, we can only provide the following information, which is based on the currently achievable state of knowledge: When you are logged into Facebook, Facebook collects data regarding your actions, interactions, and movements within its social network, which the company Facebook Inc. uses to optimize its direct marketing profile personalized for each user for its business purposes and links it to your profile and your registration data provided there and other information provided within the social network by you or by others. For the purpose and scope of data collection by Facebook and for the further processing and use of your data there, as well as your rights in this regard and the settings options you must protect your privacy, we refer you to the data protection information of Facebook, over which we have no influence: Privacy\n. Even if you are not logged in to Facebook, Facebook Inc. stores and uses data on the operating system used, the browser version, the IP address, and the place of origin derived from it. In addition, Facebook can recognize you as a non-logged-in or non-registered user via cookies and use the statistical data obtained from the page view when you next log in or register with Facebook for the first time to create a profile. Use of Twitter \"Tailored Target Groups\" and \"Conversion Tracking\" of Twitter offer the possibility to target existing users and customers who have visited the internet offer of EF with relevant campaigns. This is done by Twitter storing anonymized user data with the help of a website tag. For this purpose, a cookie from Twitter can be placed in the browser when a user visits our website. EF adheres to Twitter's conversion tracking and tailored audience policies when using this. Users who wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising from Twitter may do so, for example, through an appropriate opt-out mechanism set by Twitter. Likewise, you can change your privacy settings on Twitter accordingly. Use of Google Apps\nOur website uses Google Apps login for quick SSO login using your existing Google account, wherein no signup and email address verification is required to enable our online shop experience. This is the button with the Google logo on our my-account page or the popup page you see when you request product pricing. All data processing operations in this context are not carried out by us but by Google\u2019s single sign-on\n.

The interaction history allows you to determine the last agent a client interacted with and use that information for re-routing. Provide caller-specific routing by assigning labels such as VIP, repetitive, malicious callers. Seamlessly integrate with your CRM using the CIM APIs for static customer information and interaction histories. Finesse gadget: Customer Profile Screen Pop-up\nCustomer profiles pop up upon call arrival, along with the customer interaction history in a Finesse Agent Gadget. The interaction history tracks customer interactions with the call center across all media. Knowing which customer is calling helps agents in giving the right call treatment, and delivering a personalized customer experience. It also reduces call handling times and back and forth switching between external systems to know about customer details. View Interaction History CIM stores all customer interactions as activities. Interactions tie together activies for a particular customer in one session (for chat, within a 24 hours interval) . Activities are for example: IVR menus that the customer selects Notes/ wrap up provided by the agent. Website URLs that the customer has previously visited (if integrated with an appropriate CMS plugin and online marketing tool) Chat metadata (of Expertflow chat). Survey responses of EF Surveys Chat/Email/ SMS transcript Agent Interaction Data - AgentID, Queue, Call Duration, Call Disposition, Outbound Campaign calls Link to the form filled by the agent (ExpertFlow Agent Guidance) Link to the recorded voice file from EF Recording or a 3rd-party Voicerecording solution (currently Zoom or Andtek). New activities can be created and used by administrators. The Interaction history & Customer Profiles modules of CIM are premise-based, replace Cisco Context Services, and can optionally integrate with your CRM. For now, the customer interaction history tracks and shows only voice calls and outbound SMS activities. Customer Profiles and Lists CIM enables you to maintain customer profiles, including identifiers (such as name, email, Telephony PIN), preferences (agent/language/time-to-call ,... ) and classification information (such as Gold, Platinum). It now also allows you to tag customers based on several different scenarios via Labels. You could for example identify your VIP customers and give them special treatment more easily, by assigning them the 'VIP' label. Use the labels from within your scripts to give different treatments to different types and tags of customers. CTI Integration with CRM\nWith an existing CRM in place, the CIM APIs let you use a low-budget CTI connector to your CRM that syncs customer data with your existing CRM (such as SAP, Siebel, Microsoft Dynamics) to always show up-to-date records to agents, without a need to switch between multiple screens. All additions/changes in customer records in CIM can be synced with your CRM with the interfaces that CIM exposes. Alternatively, you can also sync customer data changes recorded within your CRM, with CIM using CIM APIs. CIM APIs for integration with external systems will be available in a future version of CIM.

This allows them to either handle multiple calls at the same time, switching back and forth between calls. This also known as call swapping/ brokering. It can also be used as an intermediate contact who then reach out to experts (nurses reaching out to doctors in a medical hotline, or lead generators reaching out to sales reps). This gadget allows you to execute these actions within a Finesse gadget, and share this info amongst multiple agents and within a callcenter context. The \u201cparking space\u201d, visible in the Finesse gadget shows a list of parked calls, along with the agent\u2019s name who initially took the call, with an attached parking reason and the total parked duration. A more advanced solution that also involves paging can be found here\n. Pricing Documentation\nForum / FAQs\nShow Pricing\nParking a call\nCall Parking transfers the call to an IVR port (IP-IVR or CVP), and makes these parked calls visible to agents in a Finesse gadget. It is possible to configure the gadget, so an agent can see all parked calls or just their own parked calls. An agent can park/swap an active contact center call with a parking reason. This toggling is a blind transfer to an IVR/CVP port or CUCM DN number. In the Finesse gadget, the call is put to a \u201cparking space\u201d, and the agent will be set automatically to READY state to retrieve the next callcenter call. He can also park a conference call. The conference call will be transferred to the parking space and all participants except the caller will be dropped from the conference. Call Retrieval from Parking\nWhen switching back a parked/swapped call, the call is blind-transferred from the IP-IVR or CVP port to the agent. An agent can switch back/unpark a call if he is in READY, NOT READY, TALKING or a WORK state.\nPick a Call from a Priority Queue\nExpertflow provides Cisco ICM/UCCE/PCCE or UCCX script to pick a call from a priority queue. As soon as a call arrives on the priority queue, it is shown on the same Call parking gadget along with the clear notification/alert (e.g., Queue Name in Red), so that the agent knows there is an incoming call in the priority queue waiting.\nAn agent can click on the \u201cpick call\u201d button which will park the current call in a parking space and the selected call from High Priority Queue will be routed to that agent.\nIf ICM finds another free agent before the request of call picking is processed, the call will be routed to that free agent, the agent who picked the call will be shown an error and the call be removed from the parking gadget. Reporting\nThe following standard reports are provided as a part of this gadget. Currently, these reports are only available for the UCCE\u00a0in CUIC.

For SMB's , it can also run in pull-mode and raise alerts via internal chat tools such as Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Slack or Rocketchat via Webhooks\n. If the bot is not able to answer the question and no agent is available, it can suggest a callback or chatback when agents become available. The bot is managing the bulk of the chat conversation and hands off to and is automatically assisted by a human agent whenever the bot's confidence score is low (\"\nhybrid chat\n\"). The bot will continue to auto-respond after a timeout, the duration of which depends on the bot's confidence score. After the handoff, the agent is also assisted by the bot - a so-called AI-assisted agent. The conversational platform can also work without bots, simply connecting multiple chat channels to agents. Enable your agents to send a chat message (such as an SMS) to the contact while they're on the call with that contact. It can also integrate with multiple bots/ dialogue engines/ virtual concierges, so the Chatframework or CC agent can choose the best answer from several bots. You are not bound to any particular bot. The chat tab of each of the 7 customers above is color-coded (green, orange, red), indicating the bot\u2019s confidence score of its NLU (Natural Language Understanding) for that particular conversation. This score also determines the hold time until the bot\u2019s primary answer will be sent, unless the agent manually overwrites the bot\u2019s suggested answer before the timeout. Hybrid Chat\nInstead of a basic handoff from a bot to a human agent, where most of the conversation will continue to be handled by an agent, Hybrid chat engages and uses the bot during the entire conversation. This reduces the workload to call center agents or allows them to handle more conversations in parallel. An agent can serve and blend in and out to multiple chats in parallel. Hybrid Chat in Cisco Finesse Hybrid Chat agent gadget can be embedded in Cisco Finesse, or it can run independently of any contact center, as a basic live chat solution. Hybrid Chat in Microsoft Dynamics 365\nHybrid Chat Agent Gadget can be embedded in Microsoft Dynamics 365 or USD (Unified Service Desk) to allow an agent to handle chats from within the CRM. The integration also allows automatic customer profile screen-pop on chat arrival. This builds on our established CRM connectors\n. Mobile Agent The mobile client for Android and iPhones enables agents to serve clients while they are on the go, without access to a desktop. Audio Notifications inform them of incoming chats. This is ideal in situations where you have either a low volume, with infrequent chat requests, or with very high volumes where you need to onboard agents on the fly. Rich Messaging\nRich Messaging, such as Carousels, buttons, Geo-location,.. are fully supported across chat channels that support these. Visual IVR Hybridchat is also a Visual IVR. Enrich or complement IVR sessions with a chat experience, for example by exchanging SMS messages with callers while they are being queued on the IVR to an agent. Chatting and choosing options from a visual menu is faster than listening through lengthy menus, so the customer experience will improve. Alternatively, for conversational IVR solutions, it allows you to capture information that might not have been captured properly by a speech recognition engine. Another use-case is to get the GPS geo-location\n. of the caller. Once the call is transferred to the agent, the agent can continue the chat session that was initiated via the visual IVR. Available with Cisco CVP\n. Media Blending and campaigns Media blending means that agents will serve alternatively voice calls or chat/ emails, depending on the volume of incoming requests as defined in the contact center's skill-based routing. Hybridchat leverages your contact center for media routing, reporting, CTI, skills, and agents, with Details of any interaction (voice, email, text) are stored in CIM\n, so if your customer calls you at noon and then calls at four, the bot will be aware that this chat might be related to a previous call. If you plan to launch an SMS campaign and a customer calls before you execute the campaign, the agent receiving a call could handle the case while he's on the call with the customer, and the scheduled OB call won't be placed. If there are many Voice Calls, you could postpone answering temporarily to Emails or Chats. Or the Chatbot could inform the user that he can\u2019t answer this particular question, but that your company would be happy to call him back once an agent becomes available. The callback request is then forwarded to the Expertflow Campaign Manager and to the Cisco Dialer. Hybridchat can be enhanced with a multi-channel campaign management license. This blog describes how chat ties into campaign management . Expertflow Hybridchat vs Cisco ECE/ Socialminer Chat Hybridchat (HC) is an alternative to and independent of Cisco ECE/ Socialminer. Hybridchat ... is a Middleware between Bots, Chat Channels, Contact centers, and CRM solutions. You remain free to switch and combine bots, chat channels, your contact center, and CRM at any point.

Exchange bots while maintaining your NLU training data Use certain bots for certain domains (small talk, address change, order fulfillment, tracking). Use bots in sequence, in particular for message filtering (SPAM, blacklists, abusive language, data loss prevention, two-factor authentication 2FA, PCI-DSS compliance) Skill based routing or pull routing\nHybridchat can use push-routing, routing as provided by a call center, or pull-routing if you only have occasional chat requests. Messaging fees\nExpertflow doesn't charge anything on a per-message base, and for channels such as Facebook Messenger, Viber, Telegram and the like these are completely free of cost. For SMS providers, you can use the lowest-cost option available in your country - for example for SMS in the US with Signalwire, receiving SMS is free, and sending SMS is .0013 USD - in other countries, an SMPP connection to your local operator is often the lowest-cost option. For Whatsapp business messages\n, and other than the Template message fees payable to Facebook we provide a fixed-price package with unlimited session messages - so if you have more than 4 agents, you'll be saving money. Hybrid chat can integrate with message aggregators such as Twilio, Messagebird, Vonage, Infobip, Plivo, and the like and has a ready-made connector to these platforms. Such platforms typically charge 0.005 cts per message sent/ received, which for a full-time agent (8hs per day * 25 days per month *120 messages per hour in either direction*0.005 cts per message) can result in a monthly cost per agent of 120 USD per agent to these aggregators.

Cubes are used to study and understand what happened, why it happened, and what changes should be made in the future. Users are free to have their own use of the cubes they can create their own tables depending on the type of analysis. Beyond these three core cubes, the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) layer of our Business Intelligence solution allows you to add further fields to your data analysis. We have also added two cubes for Call Accounting, so the same tool can be used for internal billing/ accounting to cost centers.\nHosted Approach Some of our clients deploy a data warehouse and OLAP viewer solutions on their own servers. This premise-based approach is however very CPU-consuming and costly in terms of server requirements, especially if you don't run multiple new reports every hour. This cost can be reduced by at least 90% if a hosted approach is chosen, using underlying technologies such as Amazon QuickSight and Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Microsoft Azure Data Factory. In this hosted BI approach, your data is continuously encrypted, and transferred to the hosted data warehouse, from where you can then run your data warehouse and analytics work. ExpertFlow can make all your customer collaboration data available on hosted data warehouses and OLAP viewers.

This provides the same functionality as the Cisco Socialminer Unified Queue API (UQ API) does in UCCE/ PCCE. Pricing\nDocumentation Request Quote\nWhy an Alternative to Socialminer?\nCisco's free Socialminer for UCCX provides pull-based media distribution, or limits you to the pre-built Email and chat clients. These are sufficient and good tools for most scenarios.\nEF Mediarouting for UCCX allows you to build your own email/ chat/ SMS/ video/ media customer-facing interface, route your own media to a CCX agent, and handle the media in a software that can be independent of the Finesse client and/ or Socialminer to manage email, chat or socialmedia, for example Office 365, Gmail, Lotus Notes or Socialmedia tools, such as LivePerson, Kayako, LiveAgent. Use cases\nWhile CCX continues to route voice calls as per the Skills and CSQs configured in UCCX, the MediaRouting engine provides routing for non-voice tasks if the agents are not busy on non-voice calls. The notion of \"agent\" remains the same, whereas the skillgroups are in a separate domain. We provide CUIC reports that allow you to see consolidated media reports per agent and skill group.\nPre-configured integrations exist for:\nChat and Bot frameworks Chat within CRMs such as Siebel, SAP, and Microsoft\n.\nWebRTC-Voice,Video & Screenshare\nQueuing in a branch office\nYou can also create your own front-ends or gadgets, or have your own applications to request, queue, route and manage interactions. How it works MR Engine keeps an active CTI connection with UCCX for the updated agents list with their current state. The Engine makes no impact on the voice MRD and lets CCX engine route voice calls as per the CCX definition of agent skills and CSQs.\nThe MR engine receives non-voice task such as an email or chat through a REST interface and selects an available CCX agent, who\u2019s not handling a voice call and is the most relevant agent for handling this non-voice task. Once the agent is selected, the Engine reserves the agent\u00a0(voice not-ready) and assigns the task to the agent. The CCX agent can handle the request either on a Finesse gadget or on a CRM interface such as Siebel, MS CRM, SAP, or others.\nThe agent can transfer, pause and resume the task.\nUnlike CCX chat & email, MR Engine doesn\u2019t require Cisco SocialMiner for routing of non-voice tasks.\nCCX engine manages voice-only agent-state information whereas the MR Engine manages agent-state information for all MRDs. An MRD is a channel such as Chat, Email, or SMS.\nFor all voice calls, routing is done by UCCX and the MR Engine is being updated by the voice state information.\nFor Chat requests, the Chat Connector receives external chat requests and the MR Engine routes the chat to one of the available CCX agent.\nFor email requests, the Email Connector receives new email requests and the MR Engine routes the email to one of the available CCX agents.\nCUIC reports consolidate voice and non-voice media per agent or Skillgroup.\nAgent Selection For Non-Voice Tasks The MR Engine selects an available agent based on the following criteria.\nSelect the best available agent based on the longest available algorithm matching the MR Engine agent selection criteria.\nChange the agent state to NOT_READY for voice calls (with a particular media reason)\nRoute the media request\nUpon finishing the request handling, change the agent state back to READY (to make him available to receive voice calls again)\nNote: Only one queue per channel is available with the agent selection algorithm based on \u201clongest available\u201d in the READY state.\nPrecision Queue\nMR Engine relies on Precision queues. You can dynamically map the precision queues to direct a call to the agent who best matches the non-voice task\u2019s precise needs. With the MR Engine, you can:\n* Create attributes. Attributes are characteristics with a boolean flag or a Proficiency rating from 1 to 10.\n* Assign attributes to CCX agents on the MR Engine configuration interface.\n* Create precision queues. Create Expressions and Steps while creating Precision Queues.\nCCX agents become members of the precision queues automatically based on their attributes. For instance,\n* A precision queue requires an agent who is fluent in French and is proficient in dealing with high priority trouble tickets.\n* An agent Sara is assigned attributes English = True and Trouble-tickets > 7.\n* The engine will select Sara for such tasks if there\u2019s no other free agent with a proficiency beyond 7 in Trouble-tickets.\nPriority Customer Routing\nMR Engine handles priority customer routing in support with the CC Admin Caller List module. The Caller List module allows to manage repetitive, malicious/hoax Customers or Gold/Silver customers. For more information about the Caller List module, visit Caller Lists\nCaller Lists may be created manually by the application user and may also be synchronized with the 3rd party CRM solution.\nHow does Priority Routing work?\nThe MRD Connector (Chat, Email) receives a new task.\nThe MRD connector verifies the customer priority label from CC Admin Caller Lists module.\nIf the customer is a member of a priority list, the label is passed along with the task to the MR Engine.\nThe task with the priority label assigned will be inserted to the priority MR Queue.\nThe MR engine always checks the priority queue for any new task to be routed. If there\u2019s no task in the priority queue, tasks from the regular queue will be selected.\nAgent Interface For the agent interface, MR Engine allows both a Finesse gadget front-end or an embedded CRM Connector.\nFinesse Gadget Frontend\nThe Engine supports open RESTful API for asynchronous communication with a 3rd party Finesse gadget.\nCRM Connector All the task handling including accept, reject, pause, resume and handling of the non-voice tasks such as Email and Chat will be handled directly from the embedded CRM interface. The MR Engine has planned to provide embedded adaptors for MS Dynamics CRM on-premise and 365, and Oracle Siebel. Using the MR Adaptor SDK, adaptors for other CRM solutions may be developed.\nDeployment Models\nMR Engine Dependencies\nRedundancy/Failover\nMR Engine currently supports single server deployment with a single point of failure. However, it supports integration with UCCX cluster deployment.\nThe Engine requires:\nSupervisor Tools Team Administration Module for seamless integration with CCX components and configuration synchronization.\nCustomer Interaction (CIM) Caller Lists module for handling Priority Customers\nMR Engine doesn\u2019t require Cisco SocialMiner. The Engine integrates directly with UCCX APIs, Finesse REST APIs and XMPP.\nCisco Marketplace", "metadata": {"source": "53 page_source ", "title": "ACTIVE_Media Routing for CCX", "link": "https://www.expertflow.com/uccx-media-routing/", "page_number": "2", "hour_of_update": "1", "minute_for_update": "3"}}, {"page_content": "Retail Queue / Branch Office\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX), Enterprise (UCCE or PCCE)\nA single virtual non-anonymous queue across all branches and the Contact Center, enabling Customer Service Representatives (CSR's) to serve clients through Video Terminals in Branches.\nPricing\nDocumentation Request Quote\nTraditional queuing solutions print out a ticket for specific service requests with anonymous queuing. Our retail queue solution goes beyond that and provides a single virtual queue across all branches and Cisco Contact Center, allowing Customer Service Representatives (CSR's) to serve clients not only physically, but also through Video Terminals, and to do personalized queuing based on the visitor's profile. The video example here shows how queuing is done by a virtual CSR, and customers are then served in a cubicle in the background or by in-person CSR's in a dedicated booth. Queuing can however also happen with traditional ticket printers or touchscreens.\nWhen branch A is very busy, and branch B has free CSR's, then CSR's from branch B can serve clients in branch A through voice or video call.\nRetail Queuing uses in Cisco PCCE the UQ API of Socialminer, or Expertflow's Mediarouting for UCCX\n.\nCustomer Identification: Mobile App, Tablet, Picture, Printer A visitor can identify himself for queuing by using a tablet, touchscreen, browser in the branch, by entering an identification such as his account or mobile number, entering name, swiping his bank card - which will then allow more sophisticated and personalised queuing/ routing. The same effect can be achieved if customers use a mobile app for queuing. Alternatively and for non-identified customers as in a traditional approach of a printed-out ticket can used, or customers could queue with their picture that are taken by the queuing computer.\nOverhead screens guide visitors to service counters The visitor queue number (or Name or picture, or last digits of a mobile or account number), as well as counter he should go to are displayed on Expertflow Wallboard\n, so the customer knows which counter he should visit. Additionally, estimated waiting times for new customers may be displayed.\nThe display can either be plugged into one of the client terminals or a low-cost standalone computer can be used to feed the display.\nCSR interface to receive next visitor\nThe CSR's can show their readiness for the next customer by finishing the ongoing task on their CTI client, which can be Cisco Finesse or the CRM CTI Interface. If agents use a CRM interface and if the client is identified while he is queued by entering his account/ mobile number or name, the agent will see the customer profile pop up in the CRM while the customer walks to his counter as shown in this video.\nAdvantages over traditional queuing solutions\nStatistics and queue times are managed and consolidated centrally both for the contact center and the branches, with the possibility to do drill-downs, for example to see all interactions of a customer across all channels.\nWorkforce Management/ Staffing based on traffic forecast can be done both for the contact center and for individual branches\nCallcenter technologies such as customer identification (card reader, accunt number,..), screen-popup in the CRM, and self-service on a Video IVR can be deployed once and used both in branches and the contact center\nOverflow of visitors or callers can happen via video between branches and between branches and the contact center\nCisco Marketplace", "metadata": {"source": "54 page_source ", "title": "ACTIVE_Retail Queue/ Branch Office", "link": "https://www.expertflow.com/retail-queue/", "page_number": "2", "hour_of_update": "1", "minute_for_update": "3"}}, {"page_content": " Pricing Documentation\nShow Pricing\nCustomer Information Screen-pop Any customer information such as ANI, DNIS, and ECC variables can be used to pop up a customer profile. 1.

On the Finesse gadget, an agent can then select a category and select multiple wrap-up codes grouped under the selected category.\nMultiple Wrapups\nEF Wrapup gadget allows an agent to select multiple categories against a single call. Note: Multiple wrapups will be shown in Expertflow CUIC reports but not in Cisco\u2019s default CUIC wrapup report (which contains only the first wrapup code that was selected). This feature can be disabled from the configuration file.\nMultiple Category Selection An agent can select multiple categories to list down wrap-ups codes from multiple categories. This is mainly useful when an agent wants to attach multiple wrapups from separate categories against a single call.\nAutomatic Category Selection\nIf the Category/Skill Name is passed in one of the call variables, the wrap-up gadget looks up the relevant category and automatically selects that category for an agent. For this feature to work, one needs to ensure that: the Skill/CSQ name of the call is being passed in one of the call variables. the Category created in the wrap-up configuration panel has the exact same name. Search Bar\nSearch bar saves an agent from scrolling through the wrap-up list to find the relevant wrap-up code by allowing an agent to type and search a wrap-up by name. This quick search makes it easy for an agent to select a wrap-up from a lengthy list of wrap-up codes.\nPop-up Wrap-ups on call end Wrap-up gadget provides a pop-up of the Wrap-up gadget at the call end, where an agent must apply the wrap-up/disposition code in order for the pop-up to be disappeared.\nChange Agent State\nWrap-up gadget keeps a check of if the agent has applied the wrap-up during the call or while he was in the after-call work state. If no wrap-up has been applied even in wrap-up mode, the wrap-up gadget can automatically force the agent state to Not_Ready. (The gadget sets agent state to Not_Ready two seconds before the wrap-up time ends. The duration - for example, \"two seconds\" can be edited in the configuration file. As soon as the agent selects the wrap-up for the previous call, the agent state is set to Ready. However, if the agent doesn\u2019t apply wrap-up and manually changes his state to not ready, the wrap-up gadget doesn\u2019t handle this case.\nAdmin Interface\nWrap up gadget comes with a web-based admin application where the application admin can perform the following functions: Add/Delete/Edit Wrapups Administrators can add wrapups via an easy-to-use interface. Wrapups can also be deleted and edited if required. Add/Delete/Edit Category Administrators can add, delete or edit a category as per the contact center requirements. Assign Wrapups to categories Administrators can assign wrapups to available categories as per the use case. One wrap-up can be assigned to multiple categories and this wrap-up will be available under both categories in the wrap-up gadget. Chat and Email Support Wrapup Gadget allows CC Agents to apply wrapups for chat and email conversations as well. The workflow for chat and email is as follows: The agent selects an Interaction Type (Chat, Email, Voice). The agent selects a category and relevant disposition code/wrapup. Chat/Email sessions will be automatically selected for a single session. In case of multiple sessions, a drop-down list will be available for an agent with all of his active sessions, and he can select the relevant session before applying the wrap-up. Wrap-up data will be pushed to the database along with the customer information. (Customer needs to specify which variable to be used for customer identification, e.g. email address). If an agent doesn\u2019t select wrap-up during chat/email handling, the agent state will be changed to Not-Ready. Wrapup Gadget Custom CUIC Reports\nIn addition to Cisco\u2019s default CUIC reports, Expertflow will provide the following additional CUIC report templates designed for the Wrapup gadget. Detailed Call Report This report consists of detailed stats for the Wrap Up pushed which is submitted by an agent assigned to a Skill Group. This report provides stats like Agent Name, Skill Group Name, Customer ANI, Wrap Up Name, and Call details such as Talk Time, Work Time and Hold Time.

This reduces the time of responding manually. When the bot detects that it can\u2019t recognize the user\u2019s intent, it can handoff the chat to a human agent, and continue to support the human agent.\nRequest Quote\nExportflow provides the following services:\nUnify multiple chat channels into one, both on the customer side (FB Messenger, App,..) and on the agent side (Slack, Cisco Spark, Microsoft Teams, CRM-specific that tool)\nConfigure Bots with Artificial intelligence objects (Intention / Action/ Entity), and adapt them to local languages if required.\nIntegrate with your back-office solutions, from where the bot can retrieve information to serve your customers (CRM solution, knowledge base, Q&A, document base, ERP..), and where he can implement desired actions.\nHandoff from bot to human\nWith the Expertflow Chat Framework\n, we can provide a handoff from the bot to a contact center agent with media routing/ media blending. Most bots reach a point where they can\u2019t answer the customer\u2019s request and a handoff strategy is essential when deploying a bot. Media blending means that agents can serve alternatively voice calls or chat/ emails, depending on the volume of incoming requests. So if there are many Voice Calls, you could, for example, postpone answering temporarily to Emails or Chats, or the Chatbot could inform the user that he can\u2019t answer this particular question, but that your company would be happy to call him back once an agent becomes available. It is also possible for a bot to run in parallel to a human agent, suggesting quick answers for the agent to select from. An agent can also serve multiple chats in parallel. Expertflow is an expert at managing these communication flows through the contact center. These features are available Which bot / AI/ NLP framework? Expertflow provides integration services for any of the major bot/ NLP/ AI frameworks, including Microsoft LUIS on Botframework\n, IBM Watson\n, Amazon Lex\n, Google Dialogflow\n.\nWe also deploy premise-based open-source chat solutions based on elements of rasa.ai (to define intentions/ actions/ entities), botkit.ai (for interconnection) and spacy.io (for NLP - Natural Language Processing).
